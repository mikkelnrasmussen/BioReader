15221195,"A highly sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been developed for detection of sulfathiazole (STZ, 4-amino- N-thiazol-2-yl-benzenesulfonamide). A set of haptens was synthesized in order to produce polyclonal antibodies against sulfonamides. Two ELISA formats (antibody-coated and conjugate-coated) were also investigated using all the serum/coating conjugate combinations that showed specific recognition. The developed ELISA succeeded in detection of STZ at concentrations as low as 0.03 ng mL(-1) over a measurable range of 0.12-6.71 ng mL(-1). Selectivity studies have demonstrated that other sulfonamides do not interfere significantly (<10%) with analysis of STZ by this immunochemical technique. Analysis of spiked bee honey samples by the developed ELISA method showed recoveries were good. The selectivity and sensitivity (IC(50)=1.6 ng mL(-1)) make it a suitable screening method for determination of low levels of STZ in food samples",Other,Role,ABIOT
8860695,"Autoantibodies (AAbs) to T cell receptor (TCR) determinants are produced in humans during the course of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus as well as in retroviral infections. We have examined the binding specificity of a panel of monoclonal antibodies derived from mutant viable motheaten (mev) mice against several TCR peptide determinants representing the complementary determining region 1 (CDR1) regions of various Vbeta families, and have identified one mAb, UN37-5, that shows high affinity binding with specificity for two CDR1 peptide determinants. The light and heavy chain V genes of UN37-5 were sequenced and compared to known V genes. The UN37-5 V H gene sequence represents the V H J6O6 family and is most similar to a previously reported V H gene derived from a germ line DNA fragment representing a unique J606 family V H gene. This germ line V H gene is also used by previously characterized mev derived mAbs directed against thymocyte and RBC antigens. The UN37-5 V L gene sequence represents the V K 4/5 gene family. It has 87% homology with the V K Ox-1 germline gene. The UN37-5 V K sequence has greater than 95% identity at the amino acid level with VK L chains from IgM hybridomas specific for DNA and the influenza virus hemagglutinin. The specificity of this AAb is determined by the V H CDR3 and a V K chain which has not been utilized in previously reported mev autoantibodies",Autoimm,Lupus,ABS
11745380,"Bacterial antigens recognized by CD8(+) T cells in the context of MHC class I are thought to play a crucial role in protection against pathogenic intracellular bacteria. Here, we demonstrate the induction of HLA-A*0201-restricted CD8(+) T cell responses against six new high-affinity HLA-A*0201-binding CTL epitopes, encoded within an immunodominant and highly conserved antigen of Mycobacteria, the heat shock protein 65 (hsp65). One of these epitopes, Mhsp65(9(369)), is identical in a large number of pathogenic bacteria, and is recognized in a CD8-independent fashion. Mhsp65(9(369)) could be presented by either mycobacterial hsp65-pulsed target cells or BCG-infected macrophages. Interestingly, T cells specific for this epitope did not recognize the corresponding human hsp65 homologue, probably due to structural differences as revealed by modeling studies. Furthermore, in vitro proteasome digestion analyses show that, whereas the mycobacterial hsp65 epitope is efficiently generated, the human hsp65 homologue is not, thus avoiding the induction of autoreactivity. Collectively, these findings describe high-affinity HLA class I-binding epitopes that are naturally processed and are recognized efficiently by MHC class I-restricted CD8(+) T cells, providing a rational basis for the development of subunit vaccine strategies against tuberculosis and other intracellular infectious diseases",Infectious_Disease,Actinobacteria_Proteobacteria,ACTN
15269714,"The immunogenicity of adenovirus (Ad) vectors is enhanced by virus-specific memory immune responses present in most individuals as a result of past exposure to these ubiquitous pathogens. We previously identified the first human T-cell epitope from the major capsid protein hexon, H910-924, and found that it is highly conserved among different Ad serotypes. Memory/effector T-cell responses to H910-924 were detected in 14 of 18 (78%) healthy adults by an interferon-gamma ELISPOT assay. Hexon peptide-specific CD4 T-cell lines were generated from three HLA-typed donors and analyzed using a panel of HLA homozygous B-cell lines and monoclonal antibodies to HLA class II loci. These studies reveal that the hexon epitope is restricted by HLA DP4, a class II allele present in 75% of the population. Analysis of overlapping peptides and peptides with single residue mutations identified a HLA DP4-binding motif. Additionally, antibodies to the hexon peptide were detected in all donor sera by dot blot assay and ELISA. Therefore, most individuals exhibit both memory B- and T-cell responses to this highly conserved epitope on hexon, an obligate component of all Ad vectors, including 'gutted' vectors. These data suggest that current strategies for the use of Ad gene therapy vectors will not evade memory immune responses to Ad",Infectious_Disease,dsDNA_Virus,ADE
15642995,"Recently, a novel 12-mer B-cell epitope, MKNNPIYSEGSL, in the type-specific region of equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) glycoprotein G (gG) was identified and used as an antigen for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Maeda et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 42:1095-1098, 2004). Although our prototype strain, TH20p, possesses two repeat sequences containing the B-cell epitope, the EHV-4 NS80567 strain has two repeat sequences that are not identical. One repeat sequence stretch contained the B-cell epitope, while the other contained the 11-mer, MKNNPVYSESL (underlining indicates a different amino acid). In this study, heterogeneity of the type-specific region was compared among Japanese EHV-4 isolates. The 11-mer peptide, MKNNPVYSESL, specifically reacted with sera from horses naturally infected with EHV-4 but not with sera from horses experimentally infected with EHV-4 TH20p. The 11-mer peptide may be another B-cell epitope in the type-specific region",Infectious_Disease,dsDNA_Virus,AHERP
15522917,"Major surface protein 2 (MSP2) of the bovine rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma marginale is an abundant, serologically immunodominant outer membrane protein. Immunodominance partially results from numerous CD4+ T cell epitopes in highly conserved amino and carboxy regions and the central hypervariable region of MSP2. However, in long-term cultures of lymphocytes stimulated with A. marginale, workshop cluster 1 (WC1)+ gammadelta T cells and CD4+ alphabeta T cells proliferated, leading to a predominance of gammadelta T cells. As gammadelta T cells proliferate in A. marginale-stimulated lymphocyte cultures, this study hypothesized that gammadelta T cells respond to the abundant, immunodominant MSP2. To test this hypothesis, gammadelta T cell clones were isolated from MSP2 vaccinates and assessed for antigen-specific proliferation and interferon-gamma secretion. Seven WC1+ gammadelta T cell clones responded to A. marginale and MSP2, and three of these proliferated to overlapping peptides from the conserved carboxy region. The gammadelta T cell response was not major histocompatibility complex-restricted, although it required antigen-presenting cells and was blocked by addition of antibody specific for the T cell receptor (TCR). Sequence analysis of TCR-gamma and -delta chains of peripheral blood lymphocytes identified two novel TCR-gamma chain constant (Cgamma) regions. It is important that all seven MSP2-specific gammadelta T cell clones used the same one of these novel Cgamma regions. The TCR complementarity-determining region 3 was less conserved than those of MSP2-specific CD4+ alphabeta T cell clones. Together, these data indicate that WC1+ gammadelta T cells recognize A. marginale MSP2 through the TCR and contribute to the immunodominant response to this protein",Infectious_Disease,Actinobacteria_Proteobacteria,ALPHA
15528342,"Naive T cells proliferate in response to self MHC molecules after transfer into lymphopenic hosts, a process that has been termed homeostatic proliferation (HP). Previous studies have demonstrated that HP is driven by low level signaling induced by interactions with the same MHC molecules responsible for positive selection in the thymus. Little is known about the homeostatic regulation of T cells specific for class Ib molecules, including Qa-1 and H2-M3, though it has been suggested that their capacity to undergo homeostatic expansion may be inherently limited. In this study, we demonstrate that naive 6C5 TCR transgenic T cells with specificity for Qa-1(b) have a capacity similar to conventional T cells to undergo HP after transfer into sublethally irradiated mice. Proliferation was largely dependent on the expression of beta(2)-microglobulin, and experiments with congenic recipients expressing Qa-1(a) instead of Qa-1(b) demonstrated that HP is specifically driven by Qa-1(b) and not through cross-recognition of classical class I molecules. Thus, the same MHC molecule that mediates positive selection of 6C5 T cells is also required for HP. Homeostatic expansion, like positive selection, occurs in the absence of a Qa-1 determinant modifier, the dominant self-peptide bound to Qa-1 molecules. However, experiments with TAP(-/-) recipients demonstrate a clear distinction between the ligand requirements for thymic selection and HP. Positive selection of 6C5 T cells is dependent on TAP function, thus selection is presumably mediated by TAP-dependent peptides. By contrast, HP occurs in TAP(-/-) recipients, providing an example where the ligand requirements for HP are less stringent than for thymic selection",Other,Technique_Based,ANA
15507295,"INTRODUCTION: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease, associated not only with a hypercoagulable state and recurrent fetal loss but with many diverse clinical manifestations including heart involvement, neurological manifestations, as well as skin, kidney and hematologic abnormalities. Cardiac manifestations include coronary by-pass graft and angioplasty occlusions, cardiomyopathy, cyanotic congenital heart disease, intracardiac thrombus and complications of cardiovascular surgery. The valvular heart disease was defined as Libman-Sacks nonbacterial endocarditis. Previously, we have shown a linear subendothelial deposition of anti-cardiolipin/beta2 glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) antibodies in the valve specimens derived from APS patients. The involvement of complement C3c in the pathogenesis was documented. We assessed the beta2GPI-related target epitope recognized by the anti-beta2GPI Abs on the valves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to find the beta2GPI-related target epitopes recognized by the anti-beta2GPI antibodies on the valves, we used beta2GPI-related synthetic peptides. The presence of anti-beta2GPI Abs on the studied valves was detected by anti-idiotypic antibody, followed by immunoperoxidase analysis. Biotin attached to the N-terminal of beta2GPI-related synthetic peptides and control peptide were used to identify the epitope addressed by the anti-beta2GPI Abs deposited on the patient's valve. The binding was probed by streptavidin-peroxidase and appropriate substrate. The specificity was confirmed by competition assays with control peptide and anti-idiotypic antibody. RESULTS: Among the beta2GPI-related synthetic peptides, two peptides were found in previous studies to mimic common pathogens either bacteriae or viruses, which raised a possible infectious origin for APS. One of these peptides, TLRVYK, is a specific target for anti-beta2GPI Abs deposited on the APS valves. This synthetic peptide was able to displace the anti-anti-beta2GPI anti-idiotypic Abs for binding the anti-beta2GPI Abs on the valve by a competition assay. CONCLUSION: We point to the possibility that Libman-Sacks nonbacterial endocarditis may have an infectious origin",Autoimm,Lupus,APL
15508180,"Using the major peanut allergen Ara h 2 as an example, an analytical tool enabling the determination of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-epitopes in processed food allergens was developed. We synthesized a multiple-antigenic peptide (MAP) of the IgE-reactive linear epitope 3 (amino acid positions 27-36) of Ara h 2 and raised a monospecific antiserum against this epitope to obtain a positive control for future epitope resolved diagnostics. First, a MAP of epitope 3, having a molecular mass of 7770 Da, was synthesized, purified, and its structure confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (electrospray ionization) (LC-MS(ESI)), matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF), and Edman sequencing. The MAP was then used to raise high titer antibodies in rabbits using the adjuvant Titermax and to characterize the specificity of IgE from allergenic patients sensitized to Ara h 2. The antiserum exclusively detects Ara h 2 in crude peanut extract with a titer of 10(7) by Western blot and reacts specifically with epitope 3 shown by epitope mapping for a library of solid-phase-bound synthetic 15-mer peptides covering the entire sequence of Ara h 2. Such IgE-reactive epitopes are of high analytical relevance as they could constitute the basis for epitope-specific detection systems for use in quality control in the food industry or for forensic purposes in cases of fatal reactions to otherwise undetected peanut proteins",Allergen,Plants,ARA
2444527,"Antibody regulation of hapten-specific granulomas was studied in mice in order to assess the relationship between an anti-idiotypic antibody and granuloma formation. An anti-idiotypic antibody was raised against the idiotype of an azobenzenearsonate (ABA)-specific antibody of A/J mice. The anti-idiotypic antibody was subcutaneously (s.c.) administered to syngeneic mice prior to challenge with ABA-coupled polyacrylamide beads injected into the intestinal wall. The results of such a challenge were assessed histologically for granuloma formation at 24-h intervals. Mice primed with anti-Id antibody and challenged with ABA-linked beads developed epithelioid granulomas at 72 and 96 hr post-challenge. Unprimed mice or mice primed with control antibodies did not develop granulomas when challenged with ABA-linked beads. Moreover, we found that priming with anti-Id antibody intravenously (i.v.) resulted in suppression of intestinal granuloma formation that was similar to that observed previously after priming mice i.v. with ABA-coupled spleen cells (Ginsburg et al., 1982). This study demonstrates the induction and suppression of hapten-specific granuloma formation in the intestine by an anti-Id antibody. The observations indicate a role for the idiotype-anti-idiotype interaction in regulation of hapten-specific granuloma formation, and may have implications for the manner in which the host reacts against self in the autoimmune inflammatory process",Other,Model_Antigen,AZOB
15593303,"The autoreactive response in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is dominated by an oligoclonal expansion of V beta 8(+) CD4(+) T cells. These T cells recognize the immunodominant N-terminal nonapeptide of myelin basic protein (MBP1-9) associated with the MHC class II molecule, I-A(u). Amongst the autoreactive cells, T cells bearing TCR containing the CDR3 beta motif Asp-Ala-Gly-Gly-Gly-Tyr (DAGGGY) play a dominant role in the disease process. Here we have investigated the molecular basis for antigen recognition by a representative TCR (172.10) that contains the DAGGGY motif. The roles of the three glycines in this motif in the corresponding TCR-peptide-MHC interactions have been analyzed using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance. Our data show that mutation of either of the first two glycines (G97, G98) to alanine results in soluble, recombinant TCR that do not bind to recombinant antigen at detectable levels. Mutation of the third glycine (G99) of the 172.10 TCR results in a substantial decrease in affinity. The importance of the triple glycines for antigen recognition provides an explanation at the molecular level for the recruitment of T cells bearing the DAGGGY motif into the responding repertoire during EAE induction",Autoimm,Multiple_Sclerosis,Ac1-9
15479266,"BACKGROUND: Almost 100 million allergic patients are sensitized to the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1, a 17 kDa protein containing most of the IgE epitopes present in pollens of trees belonging to the Fagales order and plant-derived food. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop an approach for the rational design of B cell epitope-derived, non-allergenic peptide allergy vaccines. METHODS: According to the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1, six peptides comprising 25-32 preferably solvent-exposed amino acids were synthesized. RESULTS: Because of lack of secondary structure, the peptides showed no allergenic activity in allergic patients. In a mouse model of birch pollen allergy, peptide vaccination induced Bet v 1-specific IgG and prevented IgE-mediated allergic sensitization to Bet v 1. The protective role of peptide-induced blocking antibodies is demonstrated by inhibition of allergic patients IgE binding to the allergen and by blocking of allergen-induced basophil degranulation. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate the mechanistic importance of blocking antibodies for allergy vaccination and present a B cell epitope-based approach for the rational design of safe peptide allergy vaccines whenever the structure of the disease-eliciting allergen is known",Allergen,Plants,BET
15664958,"GNA 1870 is a novel surface-exposed lipoprotein, identified by genome analysis of Neisseria meningitidis strain MC58, which induces bactericidal antibodies. Three sequence variants of the protein were shown to be sufficient to induce bactericidal antibodies against a panel of strains representative of the diversity of serogroup B meningococci. Here, we studied the antigenic and immunogenic properties of GNA 1870, which for convenience was divided into domains A, B, and C. The immune responses of mice immunized with each of the three variants were tested using overlapping peptides scanning the entire protein length and using recombinant fragments. We found that while most of the linear epitopes are located in the A domain, the bactericidal antibodies are directed against conformational epitopes located in the BC domain. This was also confirmed by the isolation of a bactericidal murine monoclonal antibody, which failed to recognize linear peptides on the A, B, and C domains separately but recognized a conformational epitope formed only by the combination of the B and C domains. Arginine in position 204 was identified as important for binding of the monoclonal antibody. The identification of the region containing bactericidal epitopes is an important step in the design of new vaccines against meningococci",Infectious_Disease,Actinobacteria_Proteobacteria,BETA
15708450,"The current study describes both Abeta and tau abnormalities that accumulate in the brains of aged (16-21 years), but not young (<4 years) clinically characterized cats. Diffuse plaques that were morphologically different from what is typically observed in the human brain could be detected with 4G8 (Abeta17-24) or an Abeta1-42-specific antibody but not with N-terminal Abeta or an Abeta1-40-specific antibody. SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry experiments indicated that cat brain Abeta consisted almost entirely of Abeta1-42. Markers of tau hyperphosphorylation (AT8 and PHF-1) labeled a subset of neurons in two aged animals. In the hilus of the hippocampus, a subset of AT8 positive neurons showed a sprouting morphology similar to that observed in human brain. Western blot analysis with antibodies against hyperphosphorylated tau indicated that tau is hyperphosphorylated in the aged cat and contains many of the same epitopes found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Thus, the aged cat brain develops AD-related lesions with important morphological and biochemical differences compared to human brain",Autoimm,BETAAM,BETAAM

15287746,"We used differential scanning calorimetry to study the thermal denaturation of murine major histocompatibility complex class II, I-E(k), accommodating hemoglobin (Hb) peptide mutants possessing a single amino acid substitution of the chemically conserved amino acids buried in the I-Ek pocket (positions 71 and 73) and exposed to the solvent (position 72). All of the I-Ek-Hb(mut) molecules exhibited greater thermal stability at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.4, as for the I-Ek-Hb(wt) molecule, which can explain the peptide exchange function of MHC II. The thermal stability was strongly dependent on the bound peptide sequences; the I-Ek-Hb(mut) molecules were less stable than the I-Ek-Hb(wt) molecules, in good correlation with the relative affinity of each peptide for I-Ek. This supports the notion that the bound peptide is part of the completely folded MHC II molecule. The thermodynamic parameters for I-Ek-Hb(mut) folding can explain the thermodynamic origin of the stability difference, in correlation with the crystal structural analysis, and the limited contributions of the residues to the overall conformation of the I-Ek-peptide complex. We found a linear relationship between the denaturation temperature and the calorimetric enthalpy change. Thus, although the MHC II-peptide complex could have a diverse thermal stability spectrum, depending on the amino acid sequences of the bound peptides, the conformational perturbations are limited. The variations in the MHC II-peptide complex stability would function in antigen recognition by the T cell receptor by affecting the stability of the MHC II-peptide-T cell receptor ternary complex",Other,Technique_Based,BIME
1696860,"Adjuvant arthritis in Lewis rats is a model of T cell-mediated autoimmune arthritis resembling human rheumatoid arthritis. A nonapeptide from the 65-kD heat-shock protein of Mycobacterium bovis BCG, amino acid sequence 180-188, has been described to carry the dominant immunogenic epitope(s) for both arthritis-protective and arthritogenic T cell clones. Here we demonstrate that immunizations with the synthetic nonapeptide completely protected rats against adjuvant arthritis induced by M. tuberculosis. Interestingly, deletion of the N-terminal threonine of the nonapeptide resulted in loss of the protective activity. Pretreatments with the nonapeptide resulted in an immune response to the nonapeptide and to M. tuberculosis. After immunizations with the synthetic nonapeptide, only low titres of nonapeptide-specific antibodies were produced, whereas a significant cellular immune response to the nonapeptide was observed. In addition, the protection was transferable to naive rats by spleen T cells. These findings document the requirement of a T cell-specific immune response to the dominant epitope of the 65-kD mycobacterial heat-shock protein for the protection against adjuvant arthritis and suggest the feasibility of immune intervention in autoimmune arthritis through the use of synthetic peptides",Transplant,Transplant,BLOOD
15701713,"VE-cadherin is an adhesion molecule localized at the adherens junctions of endothelial cells. It is crucial for the proper assembly of vascular structures during angiogenesis and maintaining vascular integrity. We have studied three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against murine VE-cadherin that inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth. Two of these, BV13 and 10G4, also disrupted normal vessels resulting in severe vascular leakage, while the third, E4G10, did not. The goal of the current report was to identify the epitope of E4G10, and distinguish it from those of the disruptive mAbs. We mapped the epitope of E4G10 to within the first 10 amino acids of mature VE-cadherin, and demonstrate that conserved tryptophan residues in this sequence are required for VE-cadherin mediated trans-adhesion. The disruptive mAbs target a different epitope within amino acids 45-56, which structural homology modeling suggests is not involved in trans-adhesion. From our studies, we hypothesize that E4G10 can only bind the neovasculature, where VE-cadherin has not yet engaged in trans-adhesion and its epitope is fully exposed. Thus, E4G10 can inhibit junction formation and angiogenesis but is unable to target normal vasculature because its epitope is masked. In contrast, BV13 and 10G4 bind an epitope that is accessible regardless of VE-cadherin interactions, leading to the disruption of adherens junctions. Our findings establish the immediate N-terminal region of VE-cadherin as a novel target for inhibiting angiogenesis",Other,Peptidic_Antigen,BOT

15680236,"GPX is a mammalian antioxidant selenoenzyme which protects biomembranes and other cellular components from oxidative damage by catalyzing the reduction of a variety of hydroperoxides (ROOH), using Glutathione (GSH) as the reducing substrate. The single-chain Fv fragment of the monoclonal antibody 2F3 (scFv2F3) can be converted into the selenium-containing Se-scFv2F3 by chemical modification of the serine. The new selenium-containing catalytic antibody Se-scFv2F3 acts as a glutathione peroxidase (GPX) mimic with high catalytic efficiency. In order to investigate which residue of scFv2F3 is converted into selenocysteine and to describe the proper reaction site of GSH to Se-scFv2F3, a three-dimensional structure of scFv2F3 is built by means of homology modeling. The 3D model is assessed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to determine its stability and by comparison with those of known protein structures. After the serine in the scFv2F3 is modified to selenocysteine, a catalytic antibody (abzyme) is obtained. From geometrical considerations, the solvent-accessible surface of the protein is examined. The computer-aided docking and energy minimization (EM) calculations of the abzyme-GSH complex are then carried out to explore the possible active site of the glutathione peroxidase mimic Se-scFv2F3.

15500626,"Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is an animal model of human rheumatoid arthritis that can be induced in susceptible mice by immunization with type II collagen (CII) or with collagen fragments, including cyanogen bromide (CB) peptides. One susceptible mouse strain, B10.RIII (I-Ar), has previously been found to respond to two major T-cell determinants, namely CII 610-618 (GPAGTAGAR) within CB10 and CII 445-453 (GPAGPAGER) within CB8. Although CB10 contains the immunodominant determinant, it is not arthritogenic. Using recombinant techniques, the determinant within CB10 was mutated to rCB10(T614P,A617E), generating a recombinant CB10 that in effect contained the arthritogenic epitope. When used for immunization, rCB10(T614P,A617E) was arthritogenic. This suggested that the arthritogenic property was intrinsic to the epitope and unrelated to its position within the CII molecule. To test this hypothesis, additional mutants were generated. The wild-type T-cell epitope of CB10 was deleted from its natural position, and the 'arthritogenic' GPAGPAGER T-cell epitope was inserted into the C-terminal portion of the CB10 peptide. The resulting peptide induced arthritis in B10.RIII mice. Adding a second copy of the T-cell determinant to other sites within CB10, however, had varying results. A second T-cell epitope located at the C-terminus of rCB10 significantly increased the incidence and severity of arthritis, while determinants placed in other positions had little effect. These data indicate that the T-cell epitope has intrinsic arthritogenic properties, but there are positional and structural constraints that affect its arthritogenicity. Enhanced arthritis was associated with an increased T-cell proliferation to the peptides, an increase in the level of inflammatory cytokines, and higher levels of anti-CII immunoglobulin.

Here we identified more than 200 individual major histocompatibility complex class II-associated peptides on human DCs and found that mature DCs selectively upregulated the self peptide CLIP. CLIP cosegregated together with foreign antigenic peptides in tetraspan microdomains on the surface and localized to DC-T cell synapses. The increased representation of CLIP-major histocompatibility complex class II complexes favored polarization of autologous naive T cells toward the nonpolarized and T helper type 2 (T(H)2) phenotype. There was also a considerably higher T(H)2/T(H)1 ratio in H2-DM-deficient mice, which have a CLIP(hi) phenotype, in contrast to wild-type, CLIP(lo) mice. Thus, the self peptide CLIP on DCs qualifies as an endogenous regulator in priming of T helper cells by antagonizing the polarization toward the T(H)1 phenotype",Other,Model_Antigen,CLIP
15225558,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), the causative agents for life-threatening human disease botulism, have been recognized as biological warfare agents. In this study, a neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody against botulinum neurotoxin serotype B (BoNT/B), named BTBH-N1, was developed from mice immunized with BoNT/B toxoid without non-toxic components, which are generally associated with the toxin. Western blot analysis, using recombinant toxin fragments containing light (L), N-terminal half of heavy (HN) and C-terminal half of heavy chains, indicated that BTBH-N1 recognizes linear epitopes located on the HN domain. An in vivo neutralization assay with mice, was conducted to characterize the neutralization capacity of the BTBH-N1. Only 10 microg of BTBH-N1 completely neutralized 20 units (1 unit = one 50% lethal dose) of BoNT/B. Even though the Mab (up to 100 microg) failed to protect mice challenged with 100 units, it significantly prolonged the time to death in a dose dependent manner. BTBH-N1, the first neutralizing antibody against BoNT/B, could be further developed as effective biological therapeutics for preventing and treating botulism, as well as other diseases caused by BoNT/B",Infectious_Disease,Firmicutes-Other_Bacteria,CLOS
15685627,"Immunocontraceptive vaccines against zona pellucida (ZP) proteins are being developed for brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) management in New Zealand. Mapping of B cell epitopes on the ZP2 protein of possums was undertaken in this study to define the antigenic regions that may be crucial to sperm-egg binding. The amino acid sequence of the full-length possum ZP2 protein (712 amino acids) was used to synthesize a complete set of 71 (15-mer) biotinylated peptides with an offset of five amino acids. The peptides were used in a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to identify continuous epitopes recognized by antibodies in the sera of possums immunized with recombinant possum ZP2 (rZP2) constructs. Seventeen continuous epitopes were located on possum ZP2 protein. Comparisons of the peptide binding pattern of antibodies in individual sera with the fertility status of the same immunized possums revealed three significant infertility-relevant peptide epitopes (amino acids 111-125, 301-315, and 431-445). One of these (amino acids 431-445) bound to possum spermatozoa from the caudal epididymis.

15542644,"The epitope determinants of chimpanzee Fab antibody 1A5, which have been shown to be broadly reactive to flaviviruses and efficient for cross-neutralization of dengue virus type 1 and type 2 (DENV-1 and DENV-2), were studied by analysis of DENV-2 antigenic variants. Sequence analysis showed that one antigenic variant contained a Gly-to-Val substitution at position 106 within the flavivirus-conserved fusion peptide loop of the envelope protein (E), and another variant contained a His-to-Gln substitution at position 317 in E. Substitution of Gly(106)Val in DENV-2 E reduced the binding affinity of Fab 1A5 by approximately 80-fold, whereas substitution of His(317)Gln had little or no effect on antibody binding compared to the parental virus. Treatment of DENV-2 with beta-mercaptoethanol abolished binding of Fab 1A5, indicating that disulfide bridges were required for the structural integrity of the Fab 1A5 epitope. Binding of Fab 1A5 to DENV-2 was competed by an oligopeptide containing the fusion peptide sequence as shown by competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both DENV-2 antigenic variants were shown to be attenuated, or at least similar to the parental virus, when evaluated for growth in cultured cells or for neurovirulence in mice. Fab 1A5 inhibited low pH-induced membrane fusion of mosquito C6/36 cells infected with DENV-1 or DENV-2, as detected by reduced syncytium formation. Both substitutions in DENV-2 E lowered the pH threshold for membrane fusion, as measured in a fusion-from-within assay. In the three-dimensional structure of E, Gly(106) in domain II and His(317) in domain III of the opposite E monomer were spatially close.

The two pivotal trials enrolled a total of 547 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who had a history of lupus nephritis. Evidence of clinical effectiveness of abetimus comes from analyses of data from patients with SLE and high-affinity antibodies to the DNA epitope of abetimus at baseline; a retrospective subgroup in the pivotal Phase II/III LJP-394-90-05 trial (90-05 trial) and the intent-to-treat population in the Phase III LJP-394-90-09 trial (90-09 trial). These studies enrolled SLE patients who had experienced prior renal manifestations of their disease and had elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies at baseline by Farr assay. Both were long-term studies, with a mean duration of treatment participation of 371 days in 90-05 and 310 days in 90-09 for the population of patients with high-affinity antibodies at baseline. The 90-05 and 90-09 studies, as well as all other clinical studies of abetimus, consistently showed that treatment with abetimus resulted in durable and persistent reductions in anti-dsDNA antibodies in SLE patients. Treatment with abetimus was associated with statistically significant decreases in anti-dsDNA antibody levels from baseline compared with placebo in both the 90-09 and 90-05 trials. Positive trends were noted for the incidence of renal flares and major SLE flares in patients treated with abetimus.

58456,"A system is described that allows the definition of T cell receptor specificity with some precision. It involves immunization of guinea pigs with hapten coupled to mycobacteria. The T cells of such animals respond to many but not all carriers modified by that hapten. Such T cells recognize neither hapten nor carrier alone, but rather determinants involving both the hapten and the carrier. No evidence for hapten-specific T cells was found. A model of the antigen binding site of the T cell receptor emerged from these experiments. According to this model, the T cell receptor consists of a single site of relatively large extent involving multiple subsites which are of low and roughly equal affinity. Thus, the haptenic group is not immunodominant for T cells as it is for B cells and for anti-hapten antibody. This suggests that the antigen binding receptor on T cells differs in some fundamental way from that on B cells. It is proposed that antigen recognition by T cells is mediated by an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region that is not paired with an immunoglobulin light chain variable region.",Allergen,Other_Allergen,DNP
14978130,"Myocarditis is a common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure. Chronic stages of myocarditis may be initiated by autoimmune responses to exposed cardiac Ags after myocyte damage. Cardiac myosin, a heart autoantigen, induced experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) in susceptible animals. Although cardiac myosin-induced myocarditis has been reported in Lewis rats, the main pathogenic epitope has not been identified. Using overlapping synthetic peptides of the S2 region of human cardiac myosin, we identified an amino acid sequence, S2-16 (residues 1052-1076), that induced severe myocarditis in Lewis rats. The myocarditic epitope was localized to a truncated S2-16 peptide (residues 1052-1073), which contained a sequence identical in human and rat cardiac myosin. The S2-16 peptide was not myocarditic for three other strains of rats, in which the lack of myocarditis was accompanied by the absence of strong S2-16-specific lymphocyte responses in vitro. For Lewis rats, S2-16 was characterized as a cryptic epitope of cardiac myosin because it did not recall lymphocyte and Ab responses after immunization with cardiac myosin. Lymphocytes from S2-16 immunized rats recognized not only S2-16, but also peptides in the S2-28 region. Furthermore, peptide S2-28 was the dominant epitope recognized by T cells from cardiac myosin immunized rats. S2-16 was presented by Lewis rat MHC class II molecules, and myocarditis induction was associated with an up-regulation of inflammatory cytokine production. S2-16-induced EAM provides a defined animal model to investigate mechanisms of EAM and modulation of immune responses to prevent autoimmune myocarditis",Autoimm,General_Autoimm,EAM

1751757,"Three kinds of monoclonal antibody (Mab) of different specificity have been obtained against the N-terminal disulphide knots of fibrinogen and fibrin. Their effects on different phases of fibrin polymerization have been studied. These antibodies were shown to be directed against different epitopes of the B beta(1-53) fragment of the fibrinogen molecule. The different Mab had different effects both on the rate of protofibril lateral aggregation and on the final turbidity of fibrin clots. The Mab were of three specificities: (1) those from clone 2d-2a inhibited the rate of lateral aggregation of protofibrils and decreased the turbidity of the final clot; (2) those from clone B-4C accelerated the polymerization step but did not affect clot turbidity: and (3) those from clone D-IB did not have any effect on either fibrin polymerization or final clot turbidity. The localization of the epitopes recognized by all three kinds of Mab and analysis of our own data and those of others allow us to conclude that one of the active loci involved in protofibril lateral association is situated in the B beta(15-53) fragment of the fibrinogen molecule. Fibrinopeptide B does not need to be split off for this site to function. Fibrin polymerization can occur when one of the two sites of protofibril lateral aggregation in dimeric fibrin molecules is blocked by Mab, and the final clot turbidity is then reduced. The splitting off of one of the two fibrinopeptides B in fibrinogen molecules by thrombin can take place even when the second B beta(Arg14-Gly15) bond is blocked by an antibody molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Other,Peptidic_Antigen,FIB

In this study, we propose an antigen-mediated genetically modified cell amplification (AMEGA) system employing an antibody/receptor chimera that triggers a growth signal in response to a non-toxic hapten dimer. An anti-fluorescein single-chain Fv fused to the extracellular D2 domain of erythropoietin receptor and transmembrane/intracellular domains of gp130 was expressed together with a model transgene, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) downstream of IRES sequence, by retroviral infection to IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells. Addition of fluorescein dimers connected by various oligo-DNA linkers induced selective growth of transfectants, thus leading to efficient expansion of EGFP-positive cell population. Also, digestion of the oligonucleotides by specific restriction endonuclease completely suppressed cell growth. Because these hapten dimers are not harmful for normal cells, the approach will be especially useful for reversible in vitro or in vivo expansion of genetically modified cell population employed for cell therapy and tissue engineering",Other,Model_Antigen,FITC

15640220,"As part of research exploring the feasibility of using antibody fragments to inhibit the growth of organisms implicated in dandruff, we isolated antibody fragments that bind to a cell surface protein of Malassezia furfur in the presence of shampoo. We found that phage display of llama single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs) can be extended to very harsh conditions, such as the presence of shampoo containing nonionic and anionic surfactants. We selected several VHHs that bind to the cell wall protein Malf1 of M. furfur, a fungus implicated in causing dandruff. In addition to high stability in the presence of shampoo, these VHHs are also stable under other denaturing conditions, such as high urea concentrations. Many of the stable VHHs were found to contain arginine at position 44. Replacement of the native amino acid at position 44 with arginine in the most stable VHH that lacked this arginine resulted in a dramatic further increase in the stability. The combination of the unique properties of VHHs together with applied phage display and protein engineering is a powerful method for obtaining highly stable VHHs that can be used in a wide range of applications",Infectious_Disease,Eukaryota,FUN
15663570,"BACKGROUND: Through proteomic and genomic approaches we have previously identified and characterized an alkaline serine protease that is a major allergen (88% frequency of IgE binding) of Penicillium chrysogenum (Pen ch 13). OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to identify the linear IgE-binding epitopes of Pen ch 13. METHODS: IgE-binding regions were identified by dot-blot immunoassay using 11 phage-displayed peptide fragments spanning the whole molecule of Pen ch 13. The minimal epitope requirements for IgE binding were further defined with overlapping peptides synthesized on derivatized cellulose membranes using SPOTs technology. The critical residues on the immunodominant epitopes were mapped through site-directed mutagenesis. The locations of the IgE epitopes identified were correlated with a three-dimensional structure of Pen ch 13. RESULTS: IgE antibodies in 35 serum samples reacted with at least one of the 11 peptide fragments of Pen ch 13. Peptide f-2n (residues 31-61) showed a high-intensity and the highest frequency (77%) of IgE binding. The frequencies of IgE binding to peptide f-4 (residues 93-133), f-1 (residues 1-37) and f-7 (residues 168-206) were 51%, 34% and 31%, respectively. SPOTs assay narrowed down the region of IgE binding of f-2n to residues 48-55 (GHADFGGR). Three, two and one epitope(s) that are four to nine amino acids in length, within f-4, f-1 and f-7, respectively, were found. Site-directed mutagenesis of Pen ch 13 revealed that substitution of His49 and/or Phe52 on Pen ch 13 with methionine resulted in proteins with drastic loss of IgE binding in seven sera tested. Proteins with amino acid replacements at residues 15-18 (RISS), or at residues 112 (I) and 116 (D) have lower IgE-binding reactivity in one of the two patient's sera tested. Substituting residues 117 (W), 119 (V) and 120 (K) also block most of the IgE binding in one of the two patient's sera tested. In addition, replacing residues 203 (V) and 204 (D) along with a deletion at residue 206 (Y) diminished the IgE binding in two serum samples tested. A model was constructed based on the structure of P. cyclopium subtilisin protease that has >90% (256 out of 283 amino acids) sequence identity with Pen ch 13. The major epitope (GHADFGGR) on Pen ch 13 formed a loop-like structure and was located at the surface of the allergen. CONCLUSIONS: Several linear IgE-reactive epitopes and their critical core amino acid residues were identified for the Pen ch 13 allergen. The major linear IgE-binding epitope, 48GHADFGGR55, formed a loop-like structure at the surface of the allergen. Substitution of His49 and/or Phe52 with methionine significantly reduced IgE-binding to Pen ch 13. Mapping of these results on a 3D model of the allergen provides valuable information about the molecular basis of allergenicity for Pen ch 13 and for designing specific immunotherapeutics",Allergen,Eukar,FUNG

GAD65Abs in T1DM patients are epitope specific, in contrast to those found in other GAD65Ab-positive individuals, including T2DM patients. Our aim was to assess whether epitope-specific GAD65Abs, or the additional presence of islet antigen 2 (IA-2) autoantibodies, better define T1DM phenotypes among T2DM patients. GAD65 and IA-2 autoantibodies were analyzed in 1436 Sardinian subjects classified with T2DM and in 384 nondiabetic patient controls. Autoantibody binding specificity to the N-terminal, middle (M), and C-terminal (C) portions of the GAD65 molecule was evaluated. Among the T2DM patients, 5.1% had GAD65 (P < 0.001) and 2.4% had IA-2 autoantibodies, compared with 1.3 and 1.6%, respectively, among the controls. GAD65Ab-positive T2DM patients with M+C (epitope-specific) reactivity were found to have the lowest body mass index (P < 0.001), followed by GAD65Ab/IA-2Ab-positive patients (P < 0.01), and non-M+C-reactive (non-epitope-specific) patients (P < 0.02). In GAD65Ab-positive T2DM patients, c-peptide levels were lower in M+C-reactive compared with non-M+C-reactive patients. Sardinian T2DM patients with M+C-predominant GAD65Ab reactivity have clinical features more similar to those of T1DM patients.

15099208,"BACKGROUND: Cell therapy for diabetes using teleost fish islet tissue has emerged as an intriguing alternative to the use of islet tissue from mammalian pancreases. The islet tissue, called Brockman bodies (BBs), is anatomically distinct from the pancreatic exocrine tissue and can be easily identified and isolated. Islets harvested from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), when transplanted into streptozotocin-diabetic nude mice, produce long-term normoglycemia and achieve mammalian-like glucose tolerance profiles. We asked whether tilapia express the alpha-(1,3)gal epitope, the immunodominant target of human xenogeneic responses. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunostaining with the alpha-(1,3)gal-specific IB4 lectin on tilapia BB, liver, heart, spleen, and head kidney was negative, as was staining with murine anti-alpha-gal-specific monoclonal antibodies. Absence of alpha-gal-specific binding of IB4 or murine anti-gal mAbs to dispersed BBs was confirmed by fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis. Tilapia BB cell membranes failed to reduce binding of anti-alpha-(1,3)gal-specific mAb in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) inhibition assay, while porcine and murine tissue lysates did. Tilapia BB cell lysates were shown to be devoid of alpha-1,3 galactosyltransferase activity by ELISA. Transplantation of tilapia BBs into diabetic alpha-gal knockout (gal KO) mice was not associated with accelerated xenograft rejection when compared with wild type control recipients (mean survival time 6.5 days vs. 7.2 days). Tilapia BBs failed to induce a rise in anti-gal IgG and IgM titers in gal KO mice, while the transplant of wild type mouse islets into gal KO mice caused a significant rise in anti-gal IgG and IgM antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that tilapia BBs are devoid of alpha-gal expression, and may offer an alternative to swine as a donor species for islet xenotransplantation",Transplant,Transplant,GAL
15541278,"Phage display technology makes it possible to introduce and rapidly screen diversity in antibody binding sites. Chain shuffling has been successfully used to humanize murine antibody fragments and also to obtain affinity matured variants. Here we report a different application of this method: the use of chain shuffling to overcome improper prokaryotic expression behavior of a hybridoma-derived single-chain antibody fragment. Construction and expression of such recombinant antibody fragments remain as empirical entities, hampered by the inability to express some antibody genes coming from eukaryotic cells in bacterial expression systems. Such problems are different for each combination of variable regions and can be serious enough to preclude the use of some hybridomas as sources of V regions to obtain recombinant antibody fragments. The particular binding properties and potential usefulness of some monoclonal antibodies make it highly desirable to bypass these technical limitations in order to develop smaller size therapeutic agents in the form of antibody fragments. The 14F7 mouse monoclonal antibody is one such attractive candidate due to its high specificity for the N-glycolyl GM3 ganglioside overexpressed in tumor cells and its ability to distinguish this antigen from closely related gangliosides like N-acetyl GM3. Our goal was to construct a phage-displayed single-chain Fv antibody fragment derived from 14F7. After cloning the original variable regions from the 14F7 hybridoma in a phagemid vector, we were unable to detect either binding activity or even expression of antibody fragments in bacteria, despite repetitive efforts. We constructed light-chain shuffling libraries, from which functional antibody fragments were readily selected. These combined the original 14F7 heavy chain variable region with a wide variety of unrelated murine and human light-chain variable regions. New antibody fragments retained the valuable properties of the monoclonal antibody in terms of fine specificity, affinity and tumor recognition. They were readily produced by bacteria, either in phage-displayed form or as soluble molecules, and provided a panel of potentially useful variants for cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy. Chain shuffling and phage display were found to be useful strategies for selecting antibody fragments on the basis of both prokaryotic expression and antigen binding criteria",Other,Chemical,GANG

Here, we analyze the primary CD8 response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection for reactivity to 2 IE proteins, 11 representative E proteins, and 10 representative L proteins, across a range of HLA backgrounds. Responses were consistently skewed toward epitopes in IE and a subset of E proteins, with only occasional responses to novel epitopes in L proteins. CD8(+) T cell clones to representative IE, E, and L epitopes were assayed against EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) containing lytically infected cells. This showed direct recognition of lytically infected cells by all three sets of effectors but at markedly different levels, in the order IE > E >> L, indicating that the efficiency of epitope presentation falls dramatically with progress of the lytic cycle. Thus, EBV lytic cycle antigens display a hierarchy of immunodominance that directly reflects the efficiency of their presentation in lytically infected cells; the CD8(+) T cell response thereby focuses on targets whose recognition leads to maximal biologic effect",Infectious_Disease,dsDNA_Virus,GHERP

15685550,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease is a prevalent disorder characterized by a chronic intestinal inflammation driven by HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8-restricted T cells specific for ingested wheat gluten peptides. The dominant T-cell responses are to epitopes that cluster within a stable 33mer fragment formed by physiologic digestion of distinct alpha-gliadins. Celiac disease is treated by excluding all gluten proteins from the diet. Conceivably, a diet based on baking-quality gluten from a wheat species that expresses no or few T-cell stimulatory gluten peptides should be equally well tolerated by the celiac patients and, importantly, also be beneficial for disease prevention. METHODS: To identify baking quality, harmless wheat, we followed the evolution of the wheat back to the species that most likely have contributed the AA, BB, and DD genomes to the bread wheat. Gluten were extracted from a large collection of these ancient wheat species and screened for T-cell stimulatory gluten peptides. RESULTS: Distinct differences in the intestinal T-cell responses to the diploid species were identified. Interestingly, we found that the fragments identical or equivalent to the immunodominant 33mer fragment are encoded by alpha-gliadin genes on the wheat chromosome 6D and thus absent from gluten of diploid einkorn (AA) and even certain cultivars of the tetraploid (AABB) pasta wheat. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for celiac disease because they raise the prospect of identifying or producing by breeding wheat species with low or absent levels of harmful gluten proteins",Allergen,Plants,GLUT

15634345,"Approximately 400 million allergic patients are sensitized against group 1 grass pollen allergens, a family of highly cross-reactive allergens present in all grass species. We report the eukaryotic expression of the group 1 allergen from Timothy grass, Phl p 1, in baculovirus-infected insect cells. Domain elucidation by limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry of the purified recombinant glycoprotein indicates that the C-terminal 40% of Phl p 1, a major IgE-reactive segment, represents a stable domain. This domain also exhibits a significant sequence identity of 43% with the family of immunoglobulin domain-like group 2/3 grass pollen allergens. Circular dichroism analysis demonstrates that insect cell-expressed rPhl p 1 is a folded species with significant secondary structure. This material is well behaved and is adequate for the growth of crystals that diffract to 2.9 A resolution. The importance of conformational epitopes for IgE recognition of Phl p 1 is demonstrated by the superior IgE recognition of insect-cell expressed Phl p 1 compared to Escherichia coli-expressed Phl p 1. Moreover, insect cell-expressed Phl p 1 induces potent histamine release and leads to strong up-regulation of CD203c in basophils from grass pollen allergic patients. Deglycosylated Phl p 1 frequently exhibits higher IgE binding capacity than the recombinant glycoprotein suggesting that rather the intact protein structure than carbohydrate moieties themselves are important for IgE recognition of Phl p 1.

15703421,"BACKGROUND: Antibodies against HLA antigens cause refractory allograft rejection with vasculopathy in some, but not all, patients. METHODS: We studied 33 kidney-transplant recipients who had refractory vascular rejection. Thirteen had donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies, whereas 20 did not. Malignant hypertension was present in 16 of the patients without anti-HLA antibodies, 4 of whom had seizures. The remaining 17 patients had no malignant hypertension. We hypothesized that activating antibodies targeting the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor might be involved. RESULTS: Activating IgG antibodies targeting the AT1 receptor were detected in serum from all 16 patients with malignant hypertension and without anti-HLA antibodies, but in no other patients. These receptor-activating antibodies are subclass IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies that bind to two different epitopes on the second extracellular loop of the AT1 receptor. Tissue factor expression was increased in renal-biopsy specimens from patients with these antibodies. In vitro stimulation of vascular cells with an AT1-receptor-activating antibody induced phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 kinase and increased the DNA binding activity of the transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappaB. The AT1 antagonist losartan blocked agonistic AT1-receptor antibody-mediated effects, and passive antibody transfer induced vasculopathy and hypertension in a rat kidney-transplantation model.

The protective efficacy of the influenza matrix protein epitope 58-66 (called M1), recognized in the context of human HLA-A2 molecules, was evaluated in a HLA-A2/K(b) transgenic mouse model of lethal influenza infection. Repeated subcutaneous immunizations with M1 increased the percentage of survival. This effect was mediated by T Cells since protection was abolished following in vivo depletion of all T lymphocytes, CD8(+), or CD4(+) T cells. The survival correlated with the detection of memory CD8(+) splenocytes able to proliferate in vitro upon stimulation with M1 and to bind M1-loaded HLA-A2 dimers, as well as with M1-specific T cells in the lungs, which were directly cytotoxic to influenza-infected cells following influenza challenge.

14764717,"In the present study, the recognition of epitope variants of influenza A viruses by human CTL was investigated. To this end, human CD8(+) CTL clones, specific for natural variants of the HLA-B*3501-restricted epitope in the nucleoprotein (NP(418-426)), were generated. As determined in (51)Cr release assays and by flow cytometry with HLA-B*3501-peptide tetrameric complexes, CTL clones were found to be specific for epitopes within one subtype or cross-reactive with heterosubtypic variants of the epitope. Using eight natural variants of the epitope, positions in the 9-mer important for T cell recognition and involved in escape from CTL immunity were identified and visualized using multidimensional scaling. It was shown that positions 4 and 5 in the 9-mer epitope were important determinants of T cell specificity.

15550021,"Hemophilia A patients treated with coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), and also some healthy subjects, may develop anti-FVIII antibodies (Ab), whose synthesis is driven by FVIII-specific CD4+ T cells. Some Ab block the procoagulant function of FVIII (inhibitors). Many inhibitors recognize epitopes on the FVIII A2 domain. Here, we have sought to identify A2 epitopes recognized by CD4+ T cells. We tested the proliferative response of CD4+ blood lymphocytes (BL) from hemophilia patients and healthy subjects, to overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the A2 domain sequence. Many A2 peptides induced proliferative responses of CD4+ BL from one or more subjects. The peptide-induced responses were strongest in hemophilia patients with inhibitors, weakest in healthy subjects. A2 peptides comprising residues 371-400, 621-650 and 671-690 elicited frequent and strong responses in hemophilia A patients, and especially in those with inhibitors. Healthy subjects recognized frequently only the sequence 371-400. A three-dimensional model of the A2 domain suggests that these CD4+ epitope sequences have structural features typical of 'universal' CD4+ T epitopes",Autoimm,General_Autoimm,HAEM

15457462,"OBJECTIVE: To explore prospectively the value of synovial histopathology in comparison with the value of classic parameters for diagnostic classification of spondylarthropathy (SpA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with an atypical disease presentation. METHODS: Synovial biopsy samples were obtained from 154 consecutive patients presenting for diagnostic evaluation; 67 patients fulfilled the classification criteria for RA, SpA, or other well-defined disease at the time of arthroscopy (cohort 1), and an additional 53 patients were classified after a full diagnostic reevaluation at 6 months (cohort 2). Synovial parameters with diagnostic value were identified in cohort 1 and were compared prospectively with classic diagnostic parameters in cohort 2. RESULTS: Staining with anticitrulline, staining with monoclonal antibody 12A (recognizing HLA-DR shared epitope-human cartilage glycoprotein 39(263-275) complexes), and crystal deposition had positive predictive values (PPVs) for diagnosis of >90% in patients with an atypical disease presentation (cohort 2). Using these 3 parameters, a diagnosis was predicted by synovial histopathology in 39.6% of cohort 2 patients and turned out to be correct in 90.5% of these patients at 6 months of followup. Using a multiparameter model rather than single histopathologic parameters, even better results were obtained, with a diagnostic prediction in 79.2% of samples and a PPV of 81.0%. In comparison, a similar multiparameter model using classic diagnostic criteria rather than synovial histopathology performed poorly in cohort 2; the sensitivity was 56.6% and the PPV was 73.3%, with an inferior capacity to predict SpA. Especially for the presence of crystals and anticitrulline staining, the analysis of synovial tissue had a clear added value to the analysis of synovial fluid or serum in patients with an atypical presentation. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study indicates that synovial histopathology can contribute to the multiparametric diagnostic classification of inflammatory arthritis in patients with an atypical presentation",Autoimm,RA,HC

These memory-effector T cells are recipient derived and recognize HCV peptide uniquely in the context of HLA-A2.

Engineered antibodies targeting HER2 may have agonist or antagonist effects on HER2, but little is known about whether endogenous antibodies modulate HER2 activity. Vaccination of patients with HER2 peptides successfully induced antibodies in a minority of patients with HER2-expressing malignancy. A subset of antibodies specifically suppressed phosphorylation of HER2 on tyrosine Y1248, a residue critical for HER2 signaling through extracellular signal-regulated kinase. These antibodies also suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and inhibited colony formation in soft agar. The majority of the antibodies that suppressed HER2 phosphorylation displayed specificity for amino acids 328 to 345 and 369 to 384. The isotype of anti-HER2 antibodies was predominantly IgG3 of low avidity, suggesting a Th1 response to peptide vaccine. Endogenous anti-HER2 antibodies can effectively suppress HER2 kinase activity and downstream signaling to inhibit the transformed phenotype of HER2-expressing tumor cells",Cancer,Cancer,HER2

Under an optimized condition using a heterologous format, an IC(50) of 3.51 ng/mL and the lowest detection limit of 0.065 ng/mL were obtained. When the isopropoxy group was removed from the iprovalicarb structure for the synthesis of a hapten, the resulting hapten was not successful as an immunogen, indicating that the isopropyl moiety was an important epitope, as evidenced by the cross-reactivities of some structurally related compounds. When applied to the real crop and water samples, the recoveries were in the range of 80.52-144.70% (n = 4) and 72.11-100.43% (n = 4), respectively.

15476240,"OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by the existence of a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies directed against intact nuclear structures, such as nucleosomes. The most prominent of these autoantibodies are those directed against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and histones. The majority are of the IgG isotype and show affinity maturation, both of which are known hallmarks of T cell help. Much evidence suggests that the nucleosome is a major candidate autoantigen in SLE. In this study, a novel strategy was used to identify the critical CD4+ T cell autoepitopes in nucleosomes. In addition, peptide-based therapy was then performed in a lupus animal model. METHODS: Bone marrow (BM)-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were used to examine the self-T cell responses against nucleosomes and to characterize the T cell epitope(s) of nucleosomes in (NZB x NZW)F1 (BWF1) mice. RESULTS: Several potential auto-T cell epitopes of core histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) were identified. Nucleosome-pulsed BM-derived DCs elicited release of interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma, representing a Th0 (i.e., mixed Th1 and Th2) pattern of cytokine production. In addition, intradermal immunization of BWF1 mice with the H3(111-130) peptide not only suppressed the level of anti-dsDNA and anti-single-stranded DNA IgG, but also significantly delayed the progress of glomerulonephritis in lupus-prone BWF1 mice. CONCLUSION: These results will help in understanding how pathogenic autoimmune responses develop in spontaneous SLE. This may potentially open the way to T cell-based immunotherapy for lupus",Autoimm,Lupus,HIS
28213514,"The 4E10 antibody displays an extreme breadth of HIV-1 neutralization and therefore constitutes a suitable model system for structure-guided vaccine design and immunotherapeutics against AIDS. In this regard, the relevance of autoreactivity with membrane lipids for the biological function of this antibody is still a subject of controversy. To address this dispute, herein we have compared the membrane partitioning ability of the 4E10 antibody and several of its variants, which were mutated at the region of the paratope surface in contact with the membrane interface. We first employed a physical separation approach (vesicle flotation) and subsequently carried out quantitative fluorescence measurements in an intact system (spectroscopic titration), using 4E10 Fab labeled with a polarity-sensitive fluorescent probe. Moreover, recognition of epitope peptide in membrane was demonstrated by photo-cross-linking assays using a Fab that incorporated the genetically encoded unnatural amino acid p-benzoylphenylalanine. The experimental data ruled out that the proposed stereospecific recognition of viral lipids was necessary for the function of the antibody. In contrast, our data suggest that nonspecific electrostatic interactions between basic residues of 4E10 and acidic phospholipids in the membranes contribute to the observed biological function. Moreover, the energetics of membrane partitioning indicated that 4E10 behaves as a peripheral membrane protein, tightening the binding to the ligand epitope inserted in the viral membrane. The implications of these findings for the natural production and biological function of this antibody are discussed.",HIV,HIV,HIV
15514090,"BACKGROUND: Non-(1-84) parathyroid hormone (PTH) fragments are large C-terminal fragments of PTH with a partially preserved N-terminal structure. They differ from other C-terminal PTH fragments, which do not have an N-terminal structure and do not react in intact PTH assays. We aimed to identify the minimal N-terminal structure common to all non-(1-84) PTH fragments. METHODS: Sera obtained from six healthy individuals and six patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, and six serum pools from dialysis patients with different PTH concentrations were fractionated by HPLC and analyzed by four different PTH assays. Each assay was characterized by saturation analysis of its detection antibody and capacity to react with different PTH fragments. Human PTH(1-84) [hPTH(1-84)] calibrators were normalized to an in-house hPTH(1-84) calibrator. RESULTS: The cyclase-activating PTH (CA-PTH) assay had an early (1, 2,) epitope and reacted only with hPTH(1-84). The other assays had epitopes in region (13-34). Total and intact PTH assays had epitopes proximal to position 18 and reacted equally well with hPTH(1-84) and hPTH(7-84), and the Elecsys PTH assay had an epitope distal to position 19, being saturable by hPTH(18-48) and also reacting with [Tyr(34)]hPTH(19-84). The HPLC profiles obtained with these assays showed that non-(1-84) PTH fragments did not react in the CA-PTH assay, as expected. The amount of non-(1-84) PTH detected by the other three assays was similar when the assay results were normalized to a common calibrator. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the amount of non-(1-84) PTH detected by epitopes proximal or distal to position 19 of the PTH structure is identical, indicating a common minimum structure starting before position 19. This in turn points to a probable high-affinity interaction with the C-PTH receptor, as observed previously with [Tyr(34)]hPTH(19-84) in various cell lines and in mouse osteocytes with PTH/PTHrP type I receptor ablation",Other,Role,HORM
15709713,"We have investigated the capacity of cellular vaccines based on dendritic cells loaded with human HPV16 E6/E7 oncoprotein-derived peptides to induce immune responses in vitro and to elicit protective immunity in a murine experimental model mimicking human HPV16-associated carcinomas. Dendritic cells loaded with the HPV16 E6/E7 peptides exhibiting CTL or Th epitopes (E6(41-50), E6(81-90), E6(98-107), E6(130-137), E7(49-57), and E7(44-62)) were able to stimulate in vitro DNA synthesis in syngeneic H-2b spleen cells. The priming capacity of peptide-loaded BMDC and peptide-loaded dendritic cell lines DC2.4 and JAWS II was compared. It has been found that both peptide-loaded BMDC and established dendritic cell lines can activate the syngeneic responder cells, but the priming capacity of BMDC was substantially higher. In the second set of experiments, we have examined the cytolytic activity of syngeneic spleen cells after repeated activation in vitro with BMDC loaded with HPV16 synthetic peptides containing CTL epitopes. Significant cytotoxic responses against HPV16 E6/E7 antigen-expressing TC-1 targets have been found after repeated in vitro activation with all peptides containing the CTL epitopes. In contrast, peptide E7(44-62) harbouring both Th and CTL epitopes induced significant cytotoxic responses already after single in vitro activation. This cytotoxic effect could be enhanced with admixture of the E7(49-57) peptide. Experiments with MHC class I proficient (TC-1, MK16-IFNgamma) and deficient (MK16) target cells revealed that the dendritic cells loaded with the E6/E7 HPV16 peptides activated CTLs in vitro, but not the other cytolytic effector mechanisms. The effectiveness of the peptide-loaded BMDC-based cellular vaccines was also investigated in vivo. C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice were immunized with various peptide-loaded BMDC and subsequently challenged with TC-1 cells. The strongest protective effect was achieved with the BMDC loaded with the peptide E7(44-62) harbouring both CTL and Th epitopes. Mice immunized with the E7(44-62) peptide remained tumour-free after s.c. transplantation of the TC-1 cells and exhibited long-lasting protective immunity, whereas the mice immunized with E6(81-90) and E7(49-57) peptides did not remain tumour-free and exhibited only partial inhibition of tumour growth detectable as depression of the tumour growth curves",Infectious_Disease,dsDNA_Virus,HPV
10352280,"The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a model of spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), fails to express surface MHC class II I-Eg7 molecules due to a deletion in the E alpha gene promoter. E alpha-transgenic NOD mice express the E alpha E beta g7 dimer and fail to develop either insulitis or IDDM. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of protection, most of which require peptide binding to I-Eg7. To define the requirements for peptide binding to I-Eg7, we first identified an I-Eg7-restricted T cell epitope corresponding to the sequence 4-13 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 65-kDa heat shock protein (hsp). Single amino acid substitutions at individual positions revealed a motif for peptide binding to I-Eg7 characterized by two primary anchors at relative position (p) 1 and 4, and two secondary anchors at p6 and p9. This motif is present in eight of nine hsp peptides that bind to I-Eg7 with high affinity. The I-Eg7 binding motif displays a unique p4 anchor compared with the other known I-E motifs, and major differences are found between I-Eg7 and I-Ag7 binding motifs. Analysis of peptide binding to I-Eg7 and I-Ag7 molecules as well as proliferative responses of draining lymph node cells from hsp-primed NOD and E alpha-transgenic NOD mice to overlapping hsp peptides revealed that the two MHC molecules bind different peptides. Of 80 hsp peptides tested, none bind with high affinity to both MHC molecules, arguing against some of the mechanisms hypothesized to explain protection from IDDM in E alpha-transgenic NOD mice",Autoimm,Diabetes,HSPDB
15138176,"Searching for a mechanism underlying autoimmunity in autism, we postulated that gliadin peptides, heat shock protein 60 (HSP-60), and streptokinase (SK) bind to different peptidases resulting in autoantibody production against these components. We assessed this hypothesis in patients with autism and in those with mixed connective tissue diseases. Associated with antigliadin and anti-HSP antibodies, children with autism and patients with autoimmune disease developed anti-dipeptidylpeptidase I (DPP I), anti-dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV [or CD26]) and anti-aminopeptidase N (CD13) autoantibodies. A significant percentage of autoimmune and autistic sera were associated with elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, or IgA antibodies against three peptidases, gliadin, and HSP-60. These antibodies are specific, since immune absorption demonstrated that only specific antigens (e.g., DPP IV absorption of anti-DPP IV), significantly reduced IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody levels. For direct demonstration of SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptide binding to DPP IV, microtiter wells coated with DPP IV were reacted with SK, HSP-60, and gliadin. They were then reacted with anti-DPP IV or anti-SK, anti-HSP, and antigliadin antibodies. Adding SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptides to DPP IV resulted in 27 to 43% inhibition of the DPP IV-anti-DPP IV reaction, but DPP IV-positive peptides caused 18 to 20% enhancement of antigen-antibody reactions. We propose that (i) superantigens (e.g., SK and HSP-60) and dietary proteins (e.g., gliadin peptides) in individuals with predisposing HLA molecules bind to aminopeptidases and (ii) they induce autoantibodies to peptides and tissue antigens. Dysfunctional membrane peptidases and autoantibody production may result in neuroimmune dysregulation and autoimmunity",Autoimm,RA,HSPRA
15670602,"A6 and B7 are two alphabeta T cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize the Tax peptide presented by the class I major histocompatibility molecule HLA-A2 (Tax/HLA-A2). Despite the fact that the two TCRs have different CDR loops and use different amino acid residues to contact their ligand, both receptors bind ligand with similar diagonal orientations. Here we show that they also bind with very similar binding affinities and kinetics (the DeltaDeltaG degrees for binding is approximately 0.3kcal/mol at 25 degrees C). The two receptors respond similarly to alterations in the MHC molecule, yet differ dramatically in their responses to ionic strength and temperature. The different responses to temperature indicate markedly different binding thermodynamics, which are not predictable from the surface area buried in the interfaces. A6 and B7 thus represent two TCRs that are both compatible with Tax/HLA-A2, although compatibility has been achieved through the use of different thermodynamic strategies. Finally, neither A6 nor B7 are predicted to undergo large conformational adaptations upon binding, distinguishing them from a number of other TCRs whose structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics have been characterized",Infectious_Disease,Retro-Transcribing_Virus,HTLV

All previously identified H-Y Ags are encoded by conventional open reading frames, but we report in this study the identification of a novel H-Y Ag encoded in the 5'-untranslated region of the TMSB4Y gene. An HLA-A*3303-restricted CD8(+) CTL clone was isolated from a male patient after an HSCT from his HLA-identical sister. Using a panel of cell lines carrying Y chromosome terminal deletions, a narrow region controlling the susceptibility of these target cells to CTL recognition was localized. Minigene transfection and epitope reconstitution assays identified an 11-mer peptide, EVLLRPGLHFR, designated TMSB4Y/A33, whose first amino acid was located 405 bp upstream of the TMSB4Y initiation codon. Analysis of the precursor frequency of CTL specific for recipient minor histocompatibility Ags in post-HSCT peripheral blood T cells revealed that a significant fraction of the total donor CTL response in this patient was directed against the TMSB4Y epitope. Tetramer analysis continued to detect TMSB4Y/A33-specific CD8(+) T cells at least up to 700 days post-HSCT.

15034020,"IA-2 is a major target of autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes. IA-2 responsive T cells recognize determinants within regions represented by amino acids 787-817 and 841-869 of the molecule. Epitopes for IA-2 autoantibodies are largely conformational and not well defined. In this study, we used peptide phage display and homology modeling to characterize the epitope of a monoclonal IA-2 Ab (96/3) from a human type 1 diabetic patient. This Ab competes for IA-2 binding with Abs from the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes and therefore binds a region close to common autoantibody epitopes. Alignment of peptides obtained after screening phage-displayed peptide libraries with purified 96/3 identified a consensus binding sequence of Asn-x-Glu-x-x-(aromatic)-x-x-Gly. The predicted surface on a three-dimensional homology model of the tyrosine phosphatase domain of IA-2 was analyzed for clusters of Asn, Glu, and aromatic residues and amino acids contributing to the epitope investigated using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of each of amino acids Asn(858), Glu(836), and Trp(799) reduced 96/3 Ab binding by >45%. Mutations of these residues also inhibited binding of serum autoantibodies from IA-2 Ab-positive type 1 diabetic patients.

15153481,"The BALB/cByJ mouse strain displays an immunodominant T cell response directed at the same CD4(+) T cell epitope peptide region in human IFN-beta, as detected in a human population-based assay. BALB/cByJ mice also recognize a second region of the protein with a lesser magnitude proliferative response. Critical residue testing of the immunodominant peptide showed that both BALB/cByJ mice and the human population response were dependent on an isoleucine residue at position 129. A variant IFN-beta molecule was constructed containing the single amino acid modification, I129V, in the immunodominant epitope. The variant displayed 100% of control antiproliferation activity. Mice immunized with unmodified IFN-beta responded weakly in vitro to the I129V variant. However, BALB/cByJ mice immunized with the I129V variant were unable to respond to either the I129V variant or the unmodified IFN-beta molecule by either T cell proliferation or Ag-specific IgG1 Ab production. This demonstrates that a single amino acid change in an immunodominant epitope can eliminate an immune response to an otherwise intact therapeutic protein. The elimination of the immunodominant epitope response also eliminated the response to the subdominant epitope in the protein. Modifying functionally immunodominant T cell epitopes within proteins may obviate the need for additional subdominant epitope modifications",Autoimm,General_Autoimm,IFN
16493087,"In both humans and NOD mice, particular MHC genes are primary contributors to development of the autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against pancreatic beta cells that cause type 1 diabetes (T1D). Association studies have suggested, but not proved, that the HLA-A*0201 MHC class I variant is an important contributor to T1D in humans. In this study, we show that transgenic expression in NOD mice of HLA-A*0201, in the absence of murine class I MHC molecules, is sufficient to mediate autoreactive CD8+ T cell responses contributing to T1D development. CD8+ T cells from the transgenic mice are cytotoxic to murine and human HLA-A*0201-positive islet cells. Hence, the murine and human islets must present one or more peptides in common. Islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP) is one of several important T1D autoantigens in standard NOD mice. Three IGRP-derived peptides were identified as targets of diabetogenic HLA-A*0201-restricted T cells in our NOD transgenic stock. Collectively, these results indicate the utility of humanized HLA-A*0201-expressing NOD mice in the identification of T cells and autoantigens of potential relevance to human T1D.

This analysis revealed that whilst some antibodies recognized all species, there were differential binding profiles with others. Three antibodies, MEDI-507, 6F10.3 and 4B2, recognized CD2 from human and Chimpanzee but not that from the other primates. We have cloned eight of the previously unknown primate CD2 molecules and report here their sequences for the first time. This analysis revealed that 12 amino acids formed a common set of residues in the extra cellular domain of human and Chimpanzee CD2. Using a 'knock-in' mutagenesis approach starting with Baboon CD2, which does not bind MEDI-507, 6F10.3 and 4B2, we have identified three residues in the adhesion domain of human CD2 which are critical for its binding to these mAbs. These residues, N18, K55 and T59 define a region located outside of the previously described binding regions on CD2. Affinity measurements of the mutants revealed a variety of degrees of binding restoration for MEDI-507, 6F10.3 and 4B2, indicating that there are fine differences within a given epitope. Furthermore, the analysis of the competition of several of the anti-human CD2 antibodies with each other and CD58 demonstrated the existence of a continuum of overlapping epitopes on human CD2, which is in contrast to the commonly held belief that epitopes on human CD2 are clearly segregated",Other,Peptidic_Antigen,INTG

The complex model of Fv interacting with hTNF-alpha was gained with computer-guided molecular docking method, based on which, it was predicted that the epitope recognized by Z12 was from 141 to 146 of hTNF-alpha. hTNF-alpha molecule was divided into two fragments of N-terminal region from 1 to 91 and C-terminal region from 92 to 157 with prokaryotic expression. The measured results suggested that the antigenic epitope recognized by Z12 antibody was located in the C-terminal region 92-157 of hTNF-alpha, proving the predicted result reliable preliminarily. Further experimental results showed that after hTNF-a 141-146 residues were deleted, Z12 antibody almost lost the ability to recognize the mutant, suggesting that the amino acid residues from 141 to 146 of hTNF-alpha were specially recognized by Z12 antibody",Other,Peptidic_Antigen,INTL

Hev b 6.01 contains 14 cysteine residues with multiple disulphide bridges stabilizing tertiary conformation. With the goal of a standardized specific immunotherapy we developed hypoallergenic Hev b 6.01 mutants by site-directed mutagenesis of selected cysteine residues (3, 12, 17, and 41) within the Hev b 6.02 domain. Peptides corresponding to the Hev b 6.02 domain of two of the mutants were also synthesized.

15682435,"Follicular lymphoma (FL), except grade 3B, is characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21), which results in over-expression of the Bcl-2 protein. Ten per-cent of all FLs, however, do not show Bcl-2 protein expression with standard immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal Bcl-2 antibody against residues 41-54 of the Bcl-2 protein. In this study, the biological background of 18 Bcl-2-negative FL cases grade I, II, or IIIa was investigated by immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis with alternative antibodies. Bcl-2 protein was demonstrated in five of the 18 cases and all of these carried the t(14;18) translocation. Of the 13 cases that were Bcl-2 negative with alternative antibodies, 12 lacked the t(14;18) translocation. PCR and subsequent sequence analysis of cDNA demonstrated that three cases with a t(14;18) contained somatic mutations in the translocated BCL2 gene, resulting in amino acid replacements in the region of the epitope recognized by the antibody. In conclusion, the majority of Bcl-2-negative FL lack a t(14;18) but a significant subset of these tumours are false negative due to mutations in the BCL2 gene. These findings may have consequences for the use of Bcl-2 immunohistochemistry for diagnostic purposes",Cancer,Cancer,LEU

8820099,"Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a 476 amino acid glycoprotein, mediates cholesteryl ester (CE), triglyceride, and phospholipid transfer among plasma lipoproteins. A monoclonal antibody (mAb), TP2, specific for an epitope within the last 26 amino acids of CETP has been shown to block all CETP-mediated lipid transfer, apparently by limiting access to lipid-binding sites in the carboxy terminal of CETP. A new panel of 16 anti-human CETP mAbs has now been used to further probe the structure-function relationships of CETP. Of the new mAbs, 9 partially inhibit CETP-mediated CE transfer (24-43%) from HDL to LDL. The corresponding epitopes were mapped within the CETP primary structure by the reactivity of the mAbs with CETP variants having deletions or amino acid substitutions. Of the 9 new, neutralizing mAbs, 6 are specific for epitopes situated between residues 410-450 and two others for epitopes between residues 184-260 and 332-366, respectively. The epitope of one neutralizing mAbs could not be mapped. Therefore, binding of mAbs to epitopes situated in four non-overlapping regions within CETP primary structure that are separated by as many as 280 residues can neutralize CETP-mediated CE transfer. Epitopes of mAbs that do not influence CE transfer activity map to the regions 184-260, 261-331, and 367-409, respectively. When pairs of mAbs were tested for their abilities to mutually compete for binding to immobilized CETP, competition was observed for mAbs specific for epitopes that are distant in CETP primary structure. The cross-competition patterns demonstrate that the carboxy terminal 60% of CETP adopts a compact structure. Together with previous mutagenesis studies, the data suggests that a carboxy terminal neutral lipid binding domain may be in close proximity to a lipoprotein binding region within native CETP",Other,Peptidic_Antigen,LIPO
14638756,"Clearance of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes requires antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. Recently it was shown that activation of class Ib major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted CD8(+) T cells alone is sufficient for immune protection against listeriae. A major component of the class Ib MHC-restricted T-cell response is T cells that recognize formylated peptide antigens presented by M3 molecules. Although three N-formylated peptides derived from L. monocytogenes are known to bind to M3 molecules, fMIGWII is the immunodominant epitope presented by M3 during infection of mice. The source of fMIGWII peptide is the L. monocytogenes lemA gene, which encodes a 30-kDa protein of unknown function. In this report, we describe the generation of two L. monocytogenes lemA deletion mutants. We show that lemA is not required for growth of listeriae in tissue culture cells or for virulence during infection of mice. Surprisingly, we found that fMIGWII-specific T cells were still primed following infection with lemA mutant listeriae, suggesting that L. monocytogenes contains at least one additional antigen that is cross-reactive with the fMIGWII epitope. This cross-reactive antigen appears to be a small protease-resistant molecule that is secreted by L. monocytogenes",Infectious_Disease,Firmicutes-Other_Bacteria,LIST

Studies on a British population were unable to substantiate these findings. Having found that there is an excellent and almost unique match between the PDC-E2 autoepitope and a sequence in mycobacterial hsp65s, we tested the corresponding peptides by ELISA for cross-reactivity using sera from 90 PBC patients, 40 Spanish and 50 British, and 84 pathological controls. Reactivity to the MYCGO hsp65(90-104)/human PDC-E2(212-226)pair was present in 19 (47.5%) Spanish PBC patients and in 2 (4%) of the 50 British. Reactivity was not seen in any of the controls. Simultaneous reactivity to mimics was due to cross-reactivity as confirmed by inhibition studies. Three dimensional modelling predicts mycobacterial hsp65(90-104)to be exposed on the surface of the protein. The affinity of anti-hsp65(90-104)antibody was higher than that of anti-PDC-E2(212-226). Hsp65(90-104)is a target of disease-specific cross-reactivity to PDC-E2(212-226).

Here, CD8 T lymphocytes were found to recognize a nonameric peptide on melanoma cells that comprises two noncontiguous segments of melanocytic glycoprotein gp100(PMEL17). The production of this peptide involves the excision of four amino acids and splicing of the fragments. This process was reproduced in vitro by incubating a precursor peptide of 13 amino acids with highly purified proteasomes. Splicing appears to occur by transpeptidation involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate.

15699177,"Quantitative evaluation of T cell responses of patients receiving antitumoral vaccination with a protein is difficult because of the large number of possible HLA-peptide combinations that could be targeted by the response. To evaluate the responses of patients vaccinated with protein MAGE-3, we have developed an approach that involves overnight stimulation of blood T cells with autologous dendritic cells loaded with the protein, sorting by flow cytometry of the T cells that produce IFN-gamma, cloning of these cells, and evaluation of the number of T cell clones that secrete IFN-gamma upon stimulation with the Ag. An important criterion is that T cell clones must recognize not only stimulator cells loaded with the protein, but also stimulator cells transduced with the MAGE-3 gene, so as to exclude the T cells that recognize contaminants generated by the protein production system. Using this approach it is possible to measure T cell frequencies as low as 10(-6). We analyzed the frequencies of anti-vaccine CD4 T cells in five metastatic melanoma patients who had been injected with a MAGE-3 protein without adjuvant and showed evidence of tumor regression. Anti-MAGE-3 CD4 T cells were detected in one of the five patients. The frequency of the anti-MAGE-3 CD4 T cells was estimated at 1/60,000 of the CD4 T cells in postvaccination blood samples, representing at least an 80-fold increase in the frequency found before immunization. The frequencies of one anti-MAGE-3 CD4 T cell clonotype were confirmed by PCR analysis on blood lymphocytes.

15665083,"Myelin basic protein (MBP) is a major candidate autoantigen in multiple sclerosis (MS). Its immunodominant epitope, MBP 85-99, forms a complex with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR2 with which multiple sclerosis is genetically associated. Copolymer 1 (Copaxone), a random amino acid copolymer [poly (Y,E,A,K)n] as well as two modified synthetic copolymers [poly (F,Y,A,K)n and poly (V,W,A,K)n] also form complexes with HLA-DR2 (DRA/DRB1*1501) and compete with MBP 85-99 for binding. Moreover, two high-affinity synthetic peptide 15-mers that could inhibit binding even more effectively were previously designed. Here, we show that further-modified peptide 15-mers inhibited even more strongly (in order J5 > J3 > J2) both the binding of MBP 85-99 to HLA-DR2 and IL-2 production by two MBP 85-99-specific HLA-DR2-restricted T cells. J5, J3, and J2 also suppressed both MBP 85-99-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in humanized mice and proteolipid protein 139-151-induced EAE in SJL/J mice. Moreover, none of these previously uncharacterized peptide inhibitors crossreacted with MBP 85-99- or proteolipid protein 139-151-specific T cells. In both cases, spleen and lymph node cultures stimulated with these peptides produced large amounts of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), and adoptive transfer of established T cell lines suppressed disease induction. These peptide 15-mers provide specific, nonrandom sequences that appear to be at least as effective as random copolymers in suppressing EAE in several models",Autoimm,Multiple_Sclerosis,MBP78
15316393,"This study investigated the contribution made by mitochondrial heat shock protein (hsp) 60 to methylprednisolone-mediated protection against mitochondrial membrane depolarization under hypoxic conditions. A low-flow hypoxia model was generated in isolated male, fasted, pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rat livers by reducing perfusate inflow pressure from 10 to 2.5 cm H2O for 2 h. The effects of methylprednisolone on mitochondrial membrane potential and expression of mitochondrial hsp 60 protein and mRNA were determined. We measured mitochondrial membrane potential by imaging rhodamine 123 fluorescence. Induction of mitochondrial hsp 60 was detected using two different anti-hsp 60 antibodies: one against the N-terminal signal sequence, which reacted exclusively with cytoplasmic hsp 60, and one against a different epitope, which reacted with cytoplasmic and mitochondrial hsp 60. In addition, the distribution of hsp 60 mRNA was examined using in situ hybridization. We found that under hypoxic conditions, there was a significant decline in mitochondrial membrane potential that was accompanied by a mild decline in the level of mitochondrial hsp 60, and that cytosolic hsp 60 was translocated into mitochondria. Pretreatment with methylprednisolone inhibited the declines in mitochondrial membrane potential and hsp 60 protein, as well as the translocation of cytosolic hsp 60. This raises the possibility that one way in which methylprednisolone protects the mitochondrial membrane potential under hypoxic conditions is to induce expression of mitochondrial hsp 60",Other,Role,MED
14734778,"Nickel allergy clearly involves the activation of HLA-restricted, skin-homing, Ni-specific T cells by professional APCs. Nevertheless, knowledge concerning the molecular details of metal-protein interactions underlying the transport and delivery of metal ions to APC during the early sensitization phase and their interactions with HLA and TCRs is still fragmentary. This study investigates the role of human serum albumin (HSA), a known shuttling molecule for Ni(2+) and an often-disregarded, major component of skin, in these processes. We show that Ni-saturated HSA complexes (HSA-Ni) induce and activate Ni-specific human T cells as potently as Ni salt solutions when present at equimolar concentrations classically used for in vitro T cell stimulation. However, neither HSA itself nor its Ni-binding N-terminal peptide are involved in determining the specificity of antigenic determinants. In fact, HSA could be replaced by xenogeneic albumins exhibiting sufficient affinity for Ni(2+) as determined by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore technology) or atomic absorption spectroscopy. Moreover, despite rapid internalization of HSA-Ni by APC, it was not processed into HLA-associated epitopes recognizable by Ni-specific T cells. In contrast, the presence of HSA-Ni in the vicinity of transient contacts between TCR and APC-exposed HLA molecules appeared to facilitate a specific transfer of Ni(2+) from HSA to high-affinity coordination sites created at the TCR/HLA-interface",Allergen,Other_Allergen,MET
9603457,"Proteolysis of the invariant chain (li) leads to the generation of abundant MHC class II-associated invariant chain peptides (CLIP), which bind in the MHC class II binding groove via supermotifs in a manner similar to that of antigenic peptides. We have engineered an li vector with the capacity to express any antigenic peptide of interest instead of CLIP, for T cell stimulation. When peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were pulsed with li hybrids encoding T cell epitopes of tetanus toxin or acetylcholine receptor, stimulation of T cells was dramatically enhanced compared to stimulation after priming with either the native or recombinant proteins. Site-specific insertion of antigenic sequences into the CLIP region promoted enhanced antigenicity of li hybrids which were shown to be processed intracellularly in a chloroquine-sensitive compartment. Naturally processed T helper epitopes were visualized directly on the surface of PBMC and identified as analogs of CLIP associated with MHC class II molecules.

15634879,"In this study, we suggest that CD8 levels on T cells are not static, but can change and, as a result, modulate CD8(+) T cell responses. We describe three models of CD8 modulation using novel weak-agonist (K1A) and super-agonist (C2A) altered peptide ligands of the HY smcy peptide. First, we used peripheral nonresponsive CD8(low) T cells produced after peripheral HY-D(b) MHC class I tetramer stimulation of female HY TCR transgenic and wild-type mice. Second, we used genetically lowered CD8(int) T cells from heterozygote CD8(+/0) mice. Finally, we used pre-existing nonresponsive CD8(low) T cells from male HY TCR transgenic mice. In CD8(low) and CD8(high) mice, presence of a lower level of CD8 greatly decreased the avidity of the peptide-MHC for HY TCR as reflected by avidity (K(D)) and dissociation constant (T(1/2)) measurements. All three models demonstrated that lowering CD8 levels resulted in the requirement for a higher avidity peptide-MHC interaction with the TCR to respond equivalently to unmanipulated CD8(high) T cells of the same specificity. Additionally, direct injections of wild-type HY-D(b) and C2A-D(b) tetramers into female HY TCR or female B6 mice induced a high frequency of peripheral nonresponsive CD8(low) T cells, yet C2A-D(b) was superior in inducing a primed CD8(+)CD44(+) memory population.

Thus, the goal of this study was to define the role of a single mHAg mismatch at the polymorphic H13 allele in the development of obliterative airway disease (OAD) after murine heterotopic tracheal transplantation. The H13(a) and H13(b) alleles encode for the SSVVGVWYL (SVL9) and SSVIGVWYL (SIL9) mHAgs, respectively, presented in the context of the H2D(b) MHC class I molecule. Toward this, C56BL/10SnJ (H13(a)) tracheal allografts were transplanted into congenic B10.CE-H13(b) A(w)(30NX)/Sn (H13(b)) recipients. The allografts were harvested at 30, 60, and 90 days after transplantation, and OAD lesions (epithelial damage, cellular infiltration, and luminal fibrosis) were confirmed histologically. Selected groups of mice were immunized (s.c.) or tolerized (i.v.) with the SVL9 peptide before transplantation. This single mHAg mismatch induced the development of OAD within 90 days. SVL9 immunization significantly accelerated the kinetics of the OAD lesions. In contrast, SVL9 tolerization completely abrogated the development of OAD. This was correlated with a complete abrogation of H13(a)-specific CD8(+) CTL responses with a significant reduction in the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing CTLs and the activation of TGF-beta-producing CD8(+) T cells. In conclusion, a single mHAg mismatch can induce the development of OAD. These data also suggest that mHAg-reactive CD8(+) CTLs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic lung allograft rejection in humans",Transplant,Transplant,MINOR
15647119,"BACKGROUND: Synovial sarcoma is a high-grade malignant tumor of soft tissue, characterized by the specific chromosomal translocation t(X;18), and its resultant SYT-SSX fusion gene. Despite intensive multimodality therapy, the majority of metastatic or relapsed diseases still remain incurable, thus suggesting a need for new therapeutic options. We previously demonstrated the antigenicity of SYT-SSX gene-derived peptides by in vitro analyses. The present study was designed to evaluate in vivo immunological property of a SYT-SSX junction peptide in selected patients with synovial sarcoma. METHODS: A 9-mer peptide (SYT-SSX B: GYDQIMPKK) spanning the SYT-SSX fusion region was synthesized. Eligible patients were those (i) who have histologically and genetically confirmed, unresectable synovial sarcoma (SYT-SSX1 or SYT-SSX2 positive), (ii) HLA-A*2402 positive, (iii) between 20 and 70 years old, (iv) ECOG performance status between 0 and 3, and (v) who gave informed consent. Vaccinations with SYT-SSX B peptide (0.1 mg or 1.0 mg) were given subcutaneously six times at 14-day intervals. These patients were evaluated for DTH skin test, adverse events, tumor size, tetramer staining, and peptide-specific CTL induction. RESULTS: A total of 16 vaccinations were carried out in six patients. The results were (i) no serious adverse effects or DTH reactions, (ii) suppression of tumor progression in one patient, (iii) increases in the frequency of peptide-specific CTLs in three patients and a decrease in one patient, and (iv) successful induction of peptide-specific CTLs from four patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the safety of the SYT-SSX junction peptide in the use of vaccination and also give support to the property of the peptide to evoke in vivo immunological responses. Modification of both the peptide itself and the related protocol is required to further improve the therapeutic efficacy",Cancer,Cancer,MISC

DA and LEW.1AV1 rats share the RT1(av1) haplotype. So far, no MHC class II peptide motif of RT1.D(a) molecules has been described. Sequence alignment of the beta chain of the rat MHC class II molecule RT1.D(a) with human HLA class II molecules revealed strong similarity in the peptide-binding groove of RT1.D(a) and HLA-DRB1*1501. According to the putative peptide-binding pockets of RT1.D(a), after comparison with the pockets of HLA-DRB1*1501, we predicted the peptide motif of RT1.D(a). To verify the predicted motif, naturally processed peptides were eluted by acidic treatment from immunoaffinity-purified RT1.D(a) molecules of lymphoid tissue of DA rats and subsequently analyzed by ESI tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, we performed binding studies with combinatorial nonapeptide libraries to purified RT1.D(a) molecules. Based on these studies we could define a peptide-binding motif for RT1.D(a) characterized by aliphatic amino acid residues (L, I, V, M) and of F for the peptide pocket P1, aromatic residues (F, Y, W) for P4, basic residues (K, R) for P6, aliphatic residues (I, L, V) for P7, and aromatic residues (F, Y, W) and L for P9.

15585860,"Structural and physiological facets of carbohydrate-peptide mimicry were addressed by analyzing the Ab response to alpha-d-mannopyranoside. mAbs against alpha-d-mannopyranoside were generated and screened with the carbohydrate-mimicking 12 mer (DVFYPYPYASGS) peptide. Three mAbs, 2D10, 1H11, and 1H7, which were subjected to detailed analysis, exhibit diverse V gene usage, indicating their independent germline origins. Although the mAb 1H7 was specific in binding only to the immunizing Ag, the Abs 2D10 and 1H11 recognize the 12 mer peptide as well as the immunogen, alpha-d-mannopyranoside. The Abs that recognize mimicry appear to bind to a common epitope on the peptide and do not share the mode of peptide binding with Con A. Binding kinetics and thermodynamics of Ag recognition suggest that the Ab that does not recognize peptide-carbohydrate mimicry probably has a predesigned mannopyranoside-complementing site. In contrast, the mimicry-recognizing Abs adopt the Ag-combining site only on exposure to the sugar, exploiting the conformational flexibility in the CDRs. Although the mAb 1H7 showed unique specificity toward mannopyranoside, the mimicry-recognizing Abs 2D10 and 1H11 exhibited degenerate specificities with regard to other sugar moieties. It is proposed that the degeneracy of specificity arising from the plasticity at the Ag-combining site in a subset of the Ab clones may be responsible for exhibiting molecular mimicry in the context of Ab response",Other,Peptidic_Antigen,MOAB

In the current study, we tested a strategy to prevent EAE by pretreatment of mice with genetically modified dendritic cells (DC) presenting myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide in the context of MHC class II molecules and simultaneously expressing TRAIL or Programmed Death-1 ligand (PD-L1). For genetic modification of DC, we used a recently established method to generate DC from mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) in vitro (ES-DC). ES cells were sequentially transfected with an expression vector for TRAIL or PD-L1 and an MHC class II-associated invariant chain-based MOG epitope-presenting vector. Subsequently, double-transfectant ES cell clones were induced to differentiate to ES-DC, which expressed the products of introduced genes. Treatment of mice with either of the double-transfectant ES-DC significantly reduced T cell response to MOG, cell infiltration into spinal cord, and the severity of MOG peptide-induced EAE. In contrast, treatment with ES-DC expressing MOG alone, irrelevant Ag (OVA) plus TRAIL, or OVA plus PD-L1, or coinjection with ES-DC expressing MOG plus ES-DC-expressing TRAIL or PD-L1 had no effect in reducing the disease severity. In contrast, immune response to irrelevant exogenous Ag (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) was not impaired by treatment with any of the genetically modified ES-DC. The double-transfectant ES-DC presenting Ag and simultaneously expressing immune-suppressive molecules may well prove to be an effective therapy for autoimmune diseases without inhibition of the immune response to irrelevant Ag",Autoimm,Multiple_Sclerosis,MOG

A number of anticancer immunotherapeutic strategies are being designed with the goal of inducing humoral and cellular immune responses against MUC1 mucin. Newly synthesized MUC1 mucin is also expressed on polyclonally stimulated human T cells. An immunoregulatory role has been postulated for MUC1 mucin expressed by activated T cells. We now show that several MUC1 peptide and glycopeptide epitope specific antibodies bind to activated T cells and inhibit their proliferation. Inhibition by antibody B27.29 could be reversed by glycopeptide haptens specific for the antibody. Intact antibody B27.29 and its divalent F(ab')2 fragment inhibited the proliferation of T cells undergoing T cell activation but the monovalent Fab' fragment did not, indicating that cross-linking of the MUC1 antigen on T cells is required for the inhibitory effect. MUC1 expression on activated T cells was increased in the presence of IL-12 but was not affected by IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 or TNF-alpha. Treatment of T cells inhibited by monoclonal antibody (MAb) B27.29 with either IL-2 or costimulatory anti-CD28 antibody restored proliferation to a level equivalent to that of control cultures. These results provide further support for the hypothesis that the expression of MUC1 on the activated T cell surface is associated with the regulation of T cell responses",Cancer,Cancer,MUCIN

Among our findings are the expression of PRAME in monophasic synovial sarcoma, PRAME and NY-ESO-1 in myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, and SSX2 and members of the GAGE family in malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Furthermore, the proto-oncogene DBL/MCF2 was identified as encoding a novel candidate GCA expressed by clear cell sarcoma/melanoma of soft parts (MSP).

7594588,"We have investigated the molecular basis for binding and Ag presentation of an immunodominant Th cell determinant of sperm whale myoglobin, a prototype amphipathic helical structure in the native protein. A series of peptides with three different substitutions at each position were evaluated for binding to the class II MHC molecule I-Ad and for activation of two T cell clones with distinct fine specificity, to determine the role of each residue. The assignment of MHC binding and TCR binding residues is consistent with a peptide bound as a twisted beta-strand, with 130 degrees twist similar to that of the influenza hemagglutinin peptide crystallized in the groove of HLA-DR1. This twist gives the peptide amphipathicity, with a periodicity similar to an alpha-helix without its being a helix. Two substituted peptides were discovered to be heteroclitic, but by different molecular mechanisms, one involving gain of a favorable residue and one involving loss of an unfavorable one. Complexes of both peptides with I-Ad had enormously higher affinity for the TCR, but peptide affinity for the MHC molecule was not increased, such that the wild-type peptide acted as a partial agonist and inhibited the response to the heteroclitic ones. Moreover, the magnitude of response was elevated in a way that could not be mimicked by the wild-type peptide even at higher concentration.

An antioxidant assay, with recombinant Prdx5 proteins, and evaluation of peroxide accumulation in transiently transfected cells, indicated that the mutant protein retained its enzymatic activity. The mutation in the Prdx5 protein did not generate a new HLA agretope but yielded an HLA-A*0201-restricted T cell epitope (Prdx5(110-119)). By HLA-tetramer analysis, in a tumor-invaded lymph node, >50% of mutant Prdx5-specific CD8(+) T cells (frequency 0.37%/CD8(+)) showed a CCR7(+/-) CD45RA(-) 'T(CM)' or 'T(EM)' phenotype, as found in Melan-A/MART-1-specific T cells (frequency 0.68%/CD8(+)) in the same tissue. In agreement with their memory phenotype, the Prdx5-specific T cells readily expanded in vitro in mixed lymphocyte-tumor culture, as did the Melan-/MART-1-specific T cells. By immunohistochemistry of the invaded lymph node, the mutant Prdx5 protein was expressed in all neoplastic cells, in contrast with the heterogeneous expression of shared antigens as Melan-A/MART-1, gp100 and tyrosinase. Thus, a unique tumor antigen can be as immunogenic as the melanoma differentiation antigens but, in contrast to the latter, may be retained in all metastatic cells possibly as result of the relevant cellular function exerted by the mutated protein",Cancer,Cancer,NEO

15671442,"The presence of abnormal metaphase cytogenetics (CA) is the key negative predictor of outcome in multiple myeloma (MM). Gene expression profiling (GEP) of such patients showed increased expression of NY-ESO-1 compared to patients with normal cytogenetics (60% vs. 31%, P=0.004). NY-ESO-1 was also highly expressed in relapsing MM especially those with CA (100% vs. 60.7%, P< 0.0001). GEP findings were confirmed at the protein level by immunostaining of marrow biopsies for NY-ESO-1. We detected spontaneous NY-ESO-1 specific antibodies by ELISA in 33% of patients with NY-ESO-1 positive MM, especially in CA patients (9/13;70%), but in none of the NY-ESO-1 negative MM patients (n=27) or normal donors (n=21). Spontaneous NY-ESO-1157-165 specific T-cells (0.2% to 0.6% of CD8(+) T-cells) were found in the peripheral blood of NY-ESO-1 positive MM with HLA-A*0201/NY-ESO-1157-165 tetramers. These NY-ESO-1 specific T-cells, when expanded, killed primary MM cells (50% lysis, ET ratio 10:1). Our data demonstrate that NY-ESO-1 is frequently expressed in MM with CA and is capable of eliciting spontaneous humoral and T-cell immunity. The pool of NY-ESO-1 specific cytotoxic T-cells expands easily upon NY-ESO-1 peptide stimulation and is functionally active. NY-ESO-1 should therefore be an ideal tumor target antigen for immunotherapy of poor prognosis MM",Cancer,Cancer,NYESO
15707681,"Epidermal growth factor is a potent growth-promoting factor for a variety of tissue cells in vivo and in vitro. Epidermal growth factor binds, phosphorylates, and activates epidermal growth factor receptors on the cell surface. In this study, we attempted to design functional peptide mimics by panning a phage display library on the anti-epidermal growth factor monoclonal antibody. By using anti-epidermal growth factor monoclonal antibody as a mold of the structure of the binding site of epidermal growth factor, high-efficiency probing was expected. From a random peptide phage display library, phage clones that bind to the anti-epidermal growth factor monoclonal antibody were isolated. One of the phage clones also exhibited binding activity to the epidermal growth factor receptor. The amino acid sequence of this phage clone showed slight similarity to the primary sequence of epidermal growth factor. We synthesized this motif to a 9-amino-acid intramolecularly disulfide-linked peptide. This synthetic peptide inhibited mitogenesis as well as epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, which is induced by epidermal growth factor. The present results suggest that the peptide synthesized in this study may mimic the epidermal growth factor receptor-binding region in epidermal growth factor",Allergen,Other_Allergen,OTAL
15589368,"During inhalation of allergens and experimental sepsis, formation of brominated tyrosine has been reported. In this study, we first examined the immunogenicity of brominated protein prepared by treatment of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). The immunized serum obtained reacted with brominated bovine serum albumin (BSA). The NBS dose-dependent formation of immunoreactivity, which was estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was observed, and the increase coincided with 3,5-dibromotyrosine (DiBrY) formation in the modified BSA, which was chemically determined by liquid chromatography/quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Second, by use of immunized mice, monoclonal antibodies to the brominated one were prepared. The two established novel monoclonal antibodies obtained from the immunized mice reacted with DiBrY, 3,5-dichlorotyrosine (DiClY), and 3,5-diiodotyrosine (DiIY). Moreover, 3,5-dihalo-4-hydroxybenzoic acids (3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid) were recognized by these antibodies. These results suggest that dihalogenated tyrosines (DiBrY, DiClY, and DiIY) are the epitopes. Lastly, we used the antibody in an immunohistochemical study. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was intraperitoneally administered to mice, and livers were removed. Positive staining of LPS-treated mouse liver tissues by both the anti-dihalotyrosine antibody and anti-myeloperoxidase antibody was estimated, suggesting that inflammatory tissue damage induces the formation of dihalotyrosine in vivo",Allergen,Other_Allergen,OTAP
15697247,"Glycoproteins display carbohydrate facets that serve as adhesion receptors for cells including leukocytes and bacterial cells. Our aim was to understand the role of the specialized carbohydrate motifs carried by highly glycosylated human salivary proteins in regulating the oral ecology. To date, our structural studies suggest that these molecules display a wide array of oligosaccharide structures, including many species with highly charged and/or fucosylated termini. Here, we used an immunoblot approach to gain additional information about the nature of these oligosaccharides. The results showed that MG1 and the salivary agglutinin express the MECA-79 epitope, an unusual sulfated carbohydrate structure that belongs to an important class of high-affinity (endothelial) L-selectin ligands. Unexpectedly, we discovered that in many women the expression of this epitope is hormonally regulated. Additional experiments revealed that MG1, MG2, and the salivary agglutinin also present Lewis blood group antigens, the exact repertoire varying on an individual basis. In parallel, we explored the functions of these carbohydrate motifs. Using an assay that detects L-selectin ligands, we found that the subset of MECA-79-reactive oligosaccharides displayed on salivary molecules specifically bind an L-selectin/Fc chimera. In contrast, the Lewis blood group structures are receptors for many strains of Helicobacter pylori, an organism that is implicated in the development of gastric ulcers and cancer. Together, these results suggest that MG1, MG2, and the salivary agglutinin play important roles in governing leukocyte and bacterial adhesion. Our findings suggest novel strategies, based on the relevant carbohydrate structures, for promoting or inhibiting these processes",Infectious_Disease,Firmicutes-Other_Bacteria,OTB
15652293,"In order to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of anthrax vaccine candidates a suitable small animal model is required. The inbred A/J strain of mouse has been selected as a potential model, and its immune response to immunisation with recombinant protective antigen (rPA) vaccine characterised, by assessment of rPA specific antibody production, and protection against injected challenge, with the unencapsulated STI strain of Bacillus anthracis. Studies were conducted to determine the time required post immunisation to develop a protective immune response, to define the minimum protective dose of vaccine required and to assess the long-term immune response to immunisation. From the results of these studies it was possible to establish that the A/J mouse is a consistent and robust small animal model for rPA vaccine testing. A comparison of the immune response to rPA vaccine immunisation in the Turner Outbred (TO) mouse strain was also conducted. Both inbred and outbred mouse strains displayed a predominantly Th2 biased immune response and showed a comparable antibody response to rPA immunisation.

15709165,"CD8(+) CTLs have an essential role in immune response against tumor. Although an increasing number of tumor-associated antigens that can be recognized by CTLs have been identified from human tumors, a limited number of tumor-associated antigens is known in lung cancer. In addition, because some of them are expressed in noncancerous tissues, there exist limitations in their application to tumor immunotherapy. Livin/ML-IAP is one of recently identified inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, which is overexpressed in melanoma cells. In this report, we show that Livin/ML-IAP is aberrantly expressed in many lung cancer cell lines and primary lung cancer tissues, whereas it is not detectable in normal tissues, including lung by reverse transcription-PCR methods. To identify HLA-A24-restricted T-cell epitopes of Livin/ML-IAP, eight peptides were selected from the amino acid sequence of this protein and screened for their binding affinity to HLA-A24. It was revealed that Livin7 peptide (amino acid sequence, KWFPSCQFLL) had the highest affinity to HLA-A24. By stimulating peripheral blood lymphocytes of HLA-A24-positive lung cancer patients with Livin7 peptide in vitro, the peptide-specific CTLs were successfully induced from four of five patients with Livin/ML-IAP-positive lung cancer but not from any of four patients without Livin/ML-IAP expression in their cancer tissues. Furthermore, the CTLs induced by Livin7 peptide showed cytotoxicity against Livin/ML-IAP(+) lung cancer cell lines in an HLA-A24-restricted manner. Our data suggest that Livin/ML-IAP may be an excellent target antigen in immunotherapy for lung cancer and Livin7 peptide may serve as a potent peptide vaccine for HLA-A*2402(+)/Livin(+) lung cancer patients",Cancer,Cancer,OTC
15520861,"We document here that infection of prediabetic mice with a virus expressing an H-2Kb-restricted mimic ligand to a self epitope present on beta cells accelerates the development of autoimmune diabetes. Immunization with the mimic ligand expanded autoreactive T cell populations, which was followed by their trafficking to the islets, as visualized in situ by tetramer staining. In contrast, the mimic ligand did not generate sufficient autoreactive T cells in naive mice to initiate disease. Diabetes acceleration did not occur in H-2Kb-deficient mice or in mice tolerized to the mimic ligand. Thus, arenavirus-expressed mimics of self antigens accelerate a previously established autoimmune process. Sequential heterologous viral infections might therefore act in concert to precipitate clinical autoimmune disease, even if single exposure to a viral mimic does not always cause sufficient tissue destruction",Autoimm,Diabetes,OTDB

Their spleen cells (SC) were tested for vaccinia virus-reactive helper T cell activity capable of augmenting (a) anti-trinitrophenyl (TNP) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response generated from unprimed C3H/He SC (responding cells) or (b) anti-TNP antibody response generated from TNP-primed C3H/He SC (responding cells) by the stimulation with syngeneic SC infected with vaccinia virus and subsequently modified with TNP (virus-self-TNP). The results demonstrate that cultures of responding cells plus 850 rds X-irradiated vaccinia virus-primed SC failed to enhance anti-TNP CTL or plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses when in vitro stimulation was provided by either virus-self or TNP-self alone. In contrast, these cultures resulted in appreciable augmentation of CTL and PFC responses when stimulated by virus-self-TNP. Such a helper activity provided by vaccinia virus-primed SC was revealed to be T cell mediated and antigen specific.

15643004,"Antibody responses of pigs to defined E(rns) fragments, after classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection, were studied by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Selection of various E(rns) fragments was based on an immunodominant E(rns) region encompassing three overlapping antigenic regions, amino acids 65 to 145 (E(rns)(aa) (65-145)) (AR1), 84 to 160 (E(rns)(aa) (84-160)) (AR2), and 109 to 220 (E(rns)(aa) (10)(9-220)) (AR3), identified earlier by our group (M. Lin, E. Trottier, J. Pasick, and M. Sabara, J. Biochem., in press). Defined E(rns) fragments, including AR1, AR2, AR3, E(rns)(aa) (65-160) (AR12), E(rns)(aa) (84-220) (AR23), E(rns)(aa) (65-220) (AR123), E(rns)(aa) (109-145) (the consensus region defined by the three overlapping regions), and E(rns)(aa) (109-160) (a fragment 15 amino acids larger than the consensus region), were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by nickel chelate affinity chromatography, and used to measure antibody responses in 20 sera serially collected from pigs experimentally infected with CSFV. Based on the optimum cutoffs determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis after testing 238 negative field sera from Canadian sources, all the E(rns) fragments were capable of distinguishing positive from negative antibody responses with sensitivities ranging between 75 and 90% and specificities ranging between 83.2 and 100%. Detection of antibody responses to refolded E(rns)(aa) (109-145) and E(rns)(aa) (109-160) by ELISA (this study) but not by Western blots (Lin et al., in press) indicated that the epitopes within the consensus region are conformational. When cutoff values were raised to give a specificity of 100%, four E(rns) fragments (AR2, AR23, E(rns)(aa) (109-145), and E(rns)(aa) (109-160)) offered much higher sensitivities (75 to 90%) than those obtained with other fragments (20 to 65%). E(rns)(aa) (109-145) and E(rns)(aa) (109-160) were capable of detecting antibody responses in infected pigs as early as 7 days postinfection. Demonstration of antibody responses to either one of the four fragments can thus be an alternative to use of the full-length protein in ELISA for serological diagnosis of CSFV infection.

15706605,"Phage display technologies have been increasingly utilized for the generation of therapeutic, imaging and purification reagents for a number of biological targets. Using a variety of different approaches, we have developed antibodies with high specificity and affinity for various targets ranging from small peptides to large proteins, soluble or membrane-associated as well as to activated forms of enzymes. We have applied this approach to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), often considered difficult targets for antibody therapeutics and targeting. Here we demonstrate the use of this technology for the identification of human antibodies targeting C5aR, the chemoattractant GPCR receptor for anaphylatoxin C5a. The N-terminal region (residues 1-31) of C5aR, one of the ligand binding sites, was synthesized, biotinylated and used as the target for selection. Three rounds of selection with our proprietary human Fab phage display library were performed. Screening of 768 isolates by phage ELISA identified 374 positive clones. Based on sequence alignment analysis, the positive clones were divided into 22 groups. Representative Fab clones from each group were reformatted into IgGs and tested for binding to C5aR-expressing cells, the differentiated U-937 cells. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that nine out of 16 reformatted IgGs bound to cells. Competition with a C5aR monoclonal antibody S5/1 which recognizes the same N-terminal region showed that S5/1 blocked the binding of positive cell binders to the peptide used for selections, indicating that the identified cell binding IgGs were specific to C5aR. These antibody binders represent viable candidates as therapeutic or imaging agents, illustrating that phage display technology provides a rapid means for developing antibodies to a difficult class of targets such as GPCRs.

Chemical modification, through dehydratative coupling and reductive amination, gave rise to a small library of Galbeta(1 --> 4)Glcbeta-OBn analogues (9a-f, 10, 11). UDP-[6-(3)H]Gal studies indicated that alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase recognized the C-6' modified Galbeta(1 --> 4)Glcbeta-OBn analogues (9a-f, 10, 11). Preparative scale reactions ensued, utilizing a single enzyme UDP-Gal conversion as well as a dual enzymatic system (GalE and alpha1,3GalT), taking full advantage of the more economical UDP-Glc, giving rise to compounds 6, 15-22.

METHODS: Sera were obtained from 109 consecutive SLE patients. As controls we tested sera of 65 patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), 19 patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I (APS I) and 65 healthy donors. A 15 amino acid long peptide based on a sequence within the NR2A subunit of the NMDA/glutamate receptor was synthesized. Antibodies to this peptide was determined by ELISA. Antibodies against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were measured by Chrithidia Luciliae assay. Disease activity was determined using the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI). RESULTS: Sera of 34/109 (31%) SLE patients reacted specifically with the NR2A peptide compared to only 4/65 (6.1%, p<0.001) MG patients, 1/19 (5.3%, p<0.02) APS I patients and 3/65 (4.6%, p<0.001) of healthy controls. No correlation was found between the presence of NR2A and dsDNA or anti-cardiolipin specific autoantibodies. In addition, no significant correlation was observed between the presence of NR2A specific antibodies and the SLEDAI score or any lupus-related clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number (31%) of SLE patients have NR2A specific antibodies that do not correlate with anti-dsDNA antibodies.

Passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) protects mice from lethal Ebola virus infection (J. A. Wilson, M. Hevey, R. Bakken, S. Guest, M. Bray, A. L. Schmaljohn, and M. K. Hart, Science 287:1664-1666, 2000). However, the epitopes responsible for neutralization have been only partially characterized because some of the MAbs do not recognize the short synthetic peptides used for epitope mapping. To identify the amino acids recognized by neutralizing and protective antibodies, we generated a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) containing the Ebola virus glycoprotein-encoding gene instead of the VSV G protein-encoding gene and used it to select escape variants by growing it in the presence of a MAb (133/3.16 or 226/8.1) that neutralizes the infectivity of the virus. All three variants selected by MAb 133/3.16 contained a single amino acid substitution at amino acid position 549 in the GP2 subunit. By contrast, MAb 226/8.1 selected three different variants containing substitutions at positions 134, 194, and 199 in the GP1 subunit, suggesting that this antibody recognized a conformational epitope.

Compound C-1311 at the EC(99) dose delayed progression of cells through the S phase which was followed by G2 arrest. At 48-96h after drug exposure, an increasing fraction of cells rounded up and detached from the substratum which suggested the induction of cell death. This was confirmed by the induction of DNA fragmentation as revealed by pulse field electrophoresis and DNA strand breaks by the TUNEL assay. The dying cells had also mitotic features which were evidenced by various biochemical and morphological criteria such as activation of Cdk1 kinase, presence of the mitotic epitope MPM-2 and condensation of chromatin into mitotic chromosomes in drug-treated cells.

15696102,"Background Mugwort pollen allergens are the main cause of pollinosis in late summer in Europe. Ninety-five percent of patients allergic to mugwort are sensitized to the major allergen Art v 1. In contrast to other common pollen allergens that contain multiple T-cell epitopes, Art v 1 contains only 1 immunodominant T-cell epitope (Art v 1 25-36 ). Objective To characterize the minimal epitope of Art v 1 25-36 and to investigate a possible association of Art v 1 reactivity with HLA class II phenotypes. Methods Art v 1-specific T-cell lines and clones were established from 51 patients with clinically defined mugwort pollen allergy and IgE specific for Art v 1. To define minimal epitopes and binding sites within Art v 1 25-36 , truncated and single-substitution analog peptides were used for T-cell stimulation. To study HLA restriction, monoclonal anti-HLA antibodies and antigen-presenting cells with defined HLA-DRB and -DQB1 alleles were used. HLA typing of patients with allergy was performed by hybridization with sequence-specific oligonucleotides, PCR, and nucleotide sequencing. Results In 96% of the patients, a cellular response to Art v 1 25-36 was obtained, and a core region of 5 to 10 amino acids containing 3 to 5 amino acids essential for T-cell reactivity was defined. The frequency of HLA-DRB1 * 01 in patients recognizing Art v 1 25-36 was significantly increased as compared with healthy controls (69% vs 21%; odds ratio, 8.45; P < 10 -6 ), and HLA-DRB1 * 01 was identified as the main restriction element for the presentation of the immunodominant epitope.

METHODS: The frequency of interferon-g (IFN-g)-producing HLA-A2 or HLA-B8-restricted EBV-reactive CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 49 RA patients and 26 healthy EBV carriers was evaluated in Elispot assays with 12 lytic/latent peptide epitopes. Direct staining with HLA-peptide tetramers containing 3 of these peptides was performed for comparison. The phenotype and function of these T cells was determined by FACS and cytotoxicity testing. RESULTS: IFN-g production patterns in Elispot assays revealed that EBV-specific CD8+ T cells were directed predominantly against the lytic epitopes A2/GLC and B8/RAK and to a minor extent to all the other lytic and latent epitopes tested, with no significant differences of the frequencies in patients and controls. However, although similar frequencies of CD8+ T cells stained with A2/GLC or B8/RAK tetramers in both groups, the fraction of A2/GLC or B8/RAK-reactive T cells producing IFN-g in response to specific peptide antigen was significantly lower in RA patients than controls.

15711981,"Autoimmune mechanisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of allograft vasculopathy following heart transplantation, but the autoantigens involved have been only sparsely studied. Citrate synthase (CS) enzyme is a conserved molecule, and, as an important mitochondrial autoantigen, it is protected by the 'immunological homunculus'. Tissue destruction and alteration of the immune regulatory mechanisms can induce pathological immune response against CS in other autoimmune diseases. In our present study we aimed to detect CS-specific autoantibodies in heart transplant patients, therefore, prospective, randomised clinical tests were conducted on 33 heart transplant patients and compared with 130 healthy blood donors. The level and isotype of CS antibodies were detected by simple binding indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The epitope specificities of the autoantibodies were measured on synthetic overlapping peptide sequences of CS enzyme by an indirect multi-pin ELISA method. Mainly IgM isotype CS autoantibodies were found in healthy controls, while IgG was found at higher levels and frequency (four-times higher) in heart transplant patients. Autoantibodies of IgG isotype recognise different epitopes than do autoantibodies of IgM isotype, even within the same group and individual. New epitope-specific IgG and IgM isotype autoantibodies appeared in heart transplant patients when compared with the controls. Our findings suggest a possible role of CS-specific autoantibodies in the pathomechanism of allograft vasculopathy",Transplant,Transplant,OTTRAN
15465060,"A protein microarray system containing different dilutions of 77 related and non-related proteins was used to show that IgE from subjects allergic to Brazil nut specifically recognise the seed 2S albumin protein (Ber e 1). Further, correctly folded chimaeric 2S albumin proteins containing structural epitope replacement were constructed and directed to the secretion pathway of the methylotropic yeast Pichia pastoris. Through the use of a chimaeric protein microarray system together with sera from a panel of 18 well-characterised Brazil nut allergic subjects, a structural IgE epitope of Ber e 1 was mapped to a helix-loop-helix region. The same structural region has been previously reported as the immunodominant region in related food allergens by different techniques. In conclusion, the combination of chimaeric proteins and protein microarrays will greatly facilitate the screening of a large number of individuals for a particular structural epitope and help to further our understanding of how proteins are recognised by the adaptive immune system",Allergen,Plants,OTTREES
15680423,"We have previously shown that avian reovirus (ARV) sigmaA and sigmaNS proteins possess dsRNA and ssRNA binding activity and suggested that there are two epitopes on sigmaA (I and II) and three epitopes (A, B, and C) on sigmaNS. To further define the location of epitopes on sigmaA and sigmaNS proteins and to further elucidate the biological functions of these epitopes by using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 62, 1F9, H1E1, and 4A123 against the ARV S1133 strain, the full-length and deletion fragments of S2 and S4 genes of ARV generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were cloned into pET32 expression vectors and the fusion proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 strain. Epitope mapping using MAbs and E. coli-expressed deletion fragments of sigmaA and sigmaNS of the ARV S1133 strain, synthetic peptides, and the cross reactivity of MAbs to heterologous ARV strains demonstrated that epitope II on sigmaA was located at amino acid residues (340)QWVMAGLVSAA(350) and epitope B on sigmaNS at amino acid residues (180)MLDMVDGRP(188). The MAbs (62, 1F9, and H1E1) directed against epitopes II and B did not require the native conformation of sigmaA and sigmaNS, suggesting that their binding activities were conformation-independent. On the other hand, MAb 4A123 only reacted with complete sigmaNS but not with truncated sigmaNS fusion proteins in Western blot, suggesting that the binding activity of MAb to epitope A on sigmaNS was conformation-dependent. Amino acid sequence analysis and the binding assays of MAb 62 to heterologous ARV strains suggested that epitope II on sigmaA was highly conserved among ARV strains and that this epitope is suitable as a serological marker for the detection of ARV antibodies following natural infection in chickens. On the contrary, an amino acid substitution at position 183 (M to V) in epitope B of ARV could hinder the reactivity of the sigmaNS with MAb 1F9. The sigmaNS of ARV with ssRNA-binding activity could be blocked by monoclonal antibody 1F9. The epitope B on sigmaNS is required for ssRNA binding because its deletion fully abolished the ssRNA binding activity of sigmaNS",Infectious_Disease,dsDNA_Virus,OTdsDNA
15661331,"In an attempt to develop an alternate to ELISAs using recombinant N-proteins as antigen for the sero-diagnosis of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infections of pigs I have measured the binding of nine anti-N-protein mAbs, which had been previously generated by various investigators, to overlapping peptides encompassing amino acids 19-70 of the N-proteins of the North American prototype (VR2332) and the European prototype (Lelystad virus, LV) of PRRSV. I also measured the binding of the mAbs to HerdChek ELISA plates coated with recombinant N-protein. All mAbs bound in an indirect ELISA to some of the peptides whether the mAbs had previously been reported to recognize continuous or discontinuous epitopes, but with different specificity and titer. Three mAbs bound with high titer to different linear epitopes located in amino acid segments 23-33, 31-50 and 43-56 and also with similar high titers to HerdChek plates. mAb SDOW17 bound with high titer to HerdChek plates but poorly to any of the peptides. In contrast, four mAbs bound with broad specificity to peptides containing an epitope(s) in amino acid segment 30-48, but poorly, or not at all, to HerdChek ELISA plates. Thus, this epitope is missing on the antigens of the HerdChek ELISA or is destroyed during immobilization of the antigens on the plate. A mAb to the N-protein of the closely related mouse arterivirus lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus bound to the same epitope. Abs that bound with broad specificity to an epitope(s) in the 30-50 amino acid segment were also detected by the peptide ELISA in sera of 25 field sera that were sero-positive in the HerdChek ELISA, but also in sera of pigs from two out of three herds tested that were sero-negative by this test",Infectious_Disease,ssRNA_positive,OTssRNA+

15652665,"Induction of CTL responses against protein antigens is an important aim in vaccine development. In this paper we present fusion-active virosomes as a vaccine delivery system capable of efficient induction of CTL responses in vivo. Virosomes are reconstituted viral membranes, which do not contain the genetic material of the virus they are derived from. Foreign macromolecules, including protein antigens, can be encapsulated in virosomes during the reconstitution process. Functionally reconstituted virosomes retain the cell binding and fusion characteristics of the native virus. Thus, upon uptake by cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, virosomes will deliver their content to the cell cytosol. In a previous study, we demonstrated that protein antigens delivered in this manner to dendritic cells are efficiently processed for both MHC class I and class II presentation. Here, we studied in vivo induction of cellular immune responses against virosome-encapsulated ovalbumin (OVA) in mice. As little as 0.75 microg OVA delivered by fusion-active virosomes was sufficient to induce a powerful class I MHC-restricted CTL response. All immunization routes that were used (i.m., i.p. and s.c.) resulted in efficient induction of CTL activity. The CTLs induced were cytotoxic in a standard 51Cr-release assay and produced IFNgamma in response to OVA peptide. Thus, virosomes represent an ideal antigen delivery system for induction of cellular immunity against encapsulated protein antigens",Other,Model_Antigen,OVA
3211160,"Two anti-phenyloxazolone (phOx3) and one anti-GAT MAbs from C57BL mice are shown to be coded by VH gene 186.2. This gene has been found earlier to code for several anti-NP (NNP) antibodies (Bothwell et al., 1981) and anti-GT antibodies (Rocca-Serra et al., 1983; Carmack and Pincus, 1986). The L chain partner of the VH 186.2 gene is different in anti-NP and anti-GAT antibodies (Bothwell et al., 1981; Rocca-Serra et al., 1983; Carmack and Pincus, 1986); in anti-phOx antibodies two new unrelated kappa chain V regions were found. Both of the new VK genes involved code frequently for anti-phOx antibodies in BALB/c mice but then with different VH genes. We tested five 186.2-coded antibodies for cross-reactions. Four antibodies were specific, one bound only to NNP, one only to phOx and two only to GT (GAT). The fifth antibody (anti-phOx) bound also to NNP, GAT and ABA-HOP though probably with a low affinity. This is the first demonstration that one V gene can code for three different antibody specificities. It emphasizes the role of the combinatorial element in antibody diversity",Other,Model_Antigen,OXA
15634913,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune CNS demyelinating disease in which infection may be an important initiating factor. Pathogen-induced cross-activation of autoimmune T cells may occur by molecular mimicry. Infection with wild-type Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus induces a late-onset, progressive T cell-mediated demyelinating disease, similar to MS. To determine the potential of virus-induced autoimmunity by molecular mimicry, a nonpathogenic neurotropic Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus variant was engineered to encode a mimic peptide from protease IV of Haemophilus influenzae (HI), sharing 6 of 13 aa with the dominant encephalitogenic proteolipid protein (PLP) epitope PLP(139-151). Infection of SJL mice with the HI mimic-expressing virus induced a rapid-onset, nonprogressive paralytic disease characterized by potent activation of self-reactive PLP(139-151)-specific CD4(+) Th1 responses. In contrast, mice immunized with the HI mimic-peptide in CFA did not develop disease, associated with the failure to induce activation of PLP(139-151)-specific CD4(+) Th1 cells. However, preinfection with the mimic-expressing virus before mimic-peptide immunization led to severe disease. Therefore, infection with a mimic-expressing virus directly initiates organ-specific T cell-mediated autoimmunity, suggesting that pathogen-delivered innate immune signals may play a crucial role in triggering differentiation of pathogenic self-reactive responses. These results have important implications for explaining the pathogenesis of MS and other autoimmune diseases",Autoimm,Multiple_Sclerosis,P139
15672606,"The p53 protein can adopt several conformations in cells--'latent,' 'active,' or mutant--depending on cellular stress or mutations of the TP53 gene. Today, only a few antibodies discriminating these conformations are available. We produced three new anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against epitopes of human p53. The H53C1 MAb recognizes an epitope located at the N-terminal part of the central region of p53 and can discriminate mutant from wild-type conformation. The H53C2 and H53C3 MAbs are against different epitopes within the proline-rich region of p53. Moreover, the H53C2 epitope is located in the second negative regulatory domain of p53 between residues 80 and 93. These MAbs can be used as new tools to study and modulate the cellular functions of p53",Cancer,Cancer,P53
7504072,"We have studied the induction of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to measles virus (MV) antigens expressed as vaccinia virus (VV) recombinants in a murine model. In C3H mice (H-2k) only the nucleoprotein (NP) induced a CTL response and this was shown to be cross-reactive with the closely related canine distemper virus (CDV). The presentation of this antigen was shown to be Kk-restricted. In BALB/c mice (H-2d), both the haemagglutinin (HA) and the NP induced a strong CTL response, the former being serotype-specific, whereas the latter cross-reacted with CDV. Both responses were found to be Ld-restricted. Based on the prediction for Ld T cell motifs, we tested a number of MV NP-derived nonapeptides for their capacity to sensitize P815 cells (H-2d) for lysis by spleen cells from VV-NP-immunized mice. One of these peptides, comprising amino acids 281 to 289 (Tyr-Pro-Ala-Leu-Gly-Leu-His-Glu-Phe) was as effective as cells expressing the complete NP protein.

15642994,"Attempts were made to identify and map epitopes on the nucleocapsid (N) protein of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) (Nigeria75/1 strain) using seven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and deletion mutants. At least four antigenic domains (A-I, A-II, C-I, and C-II) were identified using the MAbs. Domains A-I (MAb 33-4) and A-II (MAbs 38-4, P-3H12, and P-13A9) were determined to be located on the amino-terminal half (amino acids [aa] 1 to 262), and domains C-I (P-14C6) and C-II (P-9H10 and P-11A6) were within the carboxy-terminal region (aa 448 to 521). Nonreciprocal competition between A-II MAbs and MAbs to C-I and C-II domains was observed, indicating that they may be exposed on the surface of the N protein and spatially overlap each other. Blocking or competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies using PPRV serum antibodies revealed that epitopes on the domains A-II and C-II were immunodominant, whereas those on the domains A-I and C-I were not. The competition between MAb and rinderpest virus (RPV) serum antibodies raised against RPV strain LATC was found in two epitopes (P-3H12 and P-13A9) on the domain A-II, indicating that these epitopes may cause cross-reactivity between PPRV and RPV.

However, only undecyl-beta-D-maltoside and cyclohexyl-hexyl-beta-D-maltoside yielded well-ordered crystals suitable for high resolution x-ray crystallographic studies. The crystals belong to space group P212121 and diffract x-rays to at least 2.5 A (1 A = 0.1 nm) resolution using synchrotron radiation. The structure was determined to a resolution of 2.7 A using molecular replacement and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 20.5% (Rfree = 25.9%). The refined model includes subunits I and II and the 2 chains of the Fv fragment, 2 heme A molecules, 3 copper atoms, and 1 Mg/Mn atom, a new metal (Ca) binding site, 52 tentatively identified water molecules, and 9 detergent molecules. Only four of the water molecules are located in the cytoplasmic half of cytochrome c oxidase. Most of them are near the interface of subunits I and II. Several waters form a hydrogen-bonded cluster, including the heme propionates and the Mg/Mn binding site. The Fv fragment binds to the periplasmic polar domain of subunit II and is critically involved in the formation of the crystal lattice.

15543395,"Pemphigus are autoimmune intraepidermal blistering diseases in which immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies are directed against desmosomal glycoproteins. The aim of this study was to determine the IgG subclass profile of endemic pemphigus foliaceus (fogo selvagem) and pemphigus vulgaris utilizing indirect immunofluorescence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with pemphigus vulgaris, 25 with endemic pemphigus foliaceus (fogo selvagem), and 25 healthy controls were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence for circulating autoantibodies (total IgG and its subclasses). RESULTS: Our data revealed a significant correlation (P <.05) of disease activity and autoantibody levels in both forms of pemphigus, i.e., negative titers related to clinical remission, whereas positive results related to active disease. Immunoglobulin G subclass analysis in fogo selvagem demonstrated that in patients in remission, 56% showed positive immunoglobulin G4; in active disease, immunoglobulin G4 was the predominant subclass (100% positive in all cases). The IgG subclass profile in pemphigus vulgaris showed that in patients in remission, only 10% were positive for immunoglobulin G4; in active disease, positivity for immunoglobulin G4 was present in 78% to 88% of the cases. CONCLUSION: Subclass characterization of immunoglobulin G autoantibodies is a useful tool for pemphigus follow-up, since immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) is the subclass that is closely related to recognition of pathogenic epitopes, and consequently with disease activity. Careful monitoring should be performed for fogo selvagem in clinical remission with a homogeneous IgG4 response, since this may indicate more frequent relapses",Autoimm,General_Autoimm,PEMP
10857851,"The efficacy of two synthetic major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-derived DA (RT1.Aa) 25-mer peptides (residues 56-80 and 96-120) to modulate alloreactivity was tested in Lewis (RT1.A1) responder animals. The DA peptide 56-80, but not peptide 96-120, induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). DTH was significantly reduced by oral feeding of peptide 56-80, P = 0.004. In addition, oral feeding of this peptide in combination with a short course of cyclosporin A (CsA) prolonged graft survival of 60% of heterotope transplanted DA cardiac allografts in Lewis recipient rats. Long-term survivors developed low levels of allo-antibodies against donor tissue as compared to rejecting animals and increased levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4) within the allograft. Similarly, IL-4-secreting splenocytes were identified by flow cytometry in these animals, indicating a Th2-type cytokine pattern. However, graft survival was particularly limited to cardiac allografts because donor-type skin grafts were acutely rejected in tolerant animals. It is interesting that residue alignment of peptide 56-80 to the motif of the RT1.A1 molecule showed a preferred class I motif within this sequence, suggesting indirect presentation of this peptide to recipient T cells. Thus, peptide 56-80 appears to represent a dominant epitope that can be exploited for establishing tolerance in this transplantation strain combination",Transplant,Transplant,PEP
6204002,"The requirements for T cell/B cell interaction for the induction of primary in vitro antibody responses to phosphorylcholine (PC)-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) were examined. Long-term helper T cell lines derived from KLH-primed (CBA/N X BALB/c) F1 female mice (H-2k/d) were able to support a T15-idiotype dominant, IgM anti-PC response of BALB/c (H-2d) B cells and macrophages, but could not activate PC-specific responses by BALB.B (H-2b) B cells, even in the presence of irradiated H-2k/d antigen-presenting cells. Polyclonal IgM secretion in the same cultures did not appear to depend upon a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T-B interaction. Since IgM anti-PC responses seem to be entirely derived from the Lyb5+ B cell subpopulation, we conclude that at least some Lyb5+ B cells can only be activated by MHC-restricted T-B interactions. We also found that xid B cells from (CBA/N X BALB/c) F1 male mice could be polyclonally activated by helper T cell lines by an apparently MHC-unrestricted interaction. Our data thus suggests that residence in the Lyb5- or Lyb5+ B cell subset does not determine the T:B interaction requirements for antibody synthesis",Other,Model_Antigen,PHOS
15681055,"Intracerebral infection of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) induces immune-mediated demyelinating disease in some mouse strains but not in others. We report here for the first time two new predominant capsid epitopes (VP4(21-40) and VP2(201-220)) recognized by CD4(+) T cells from virus-infected resistant C57BL/6 mice based on IFNgamma ELISPOT assay utilizing a 20-mer peptide library covering the entire capsid proteins. Further experiments by IFNgamma ELISPOT and flow cytometry for intracellular IFNgamma production using truncated peptides indicated that the epitope regions recognized by CNS-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells are VP4(25-38) and VP2(206-220), respectively. No apparent reduction in the T cell response to these viral epitopes is seen in the CNS of IL-12- and ICAM-1-deficient C57BL/6 mice compared to those in control C57BL/6 mice, suggesting that T cell response to TMEV in the CNS is largely insensitive to the absence of these proinflammatory cytokine and adhesion molecules.

15710912,"The immunogenicity of recombinant protein or anti-viral DNA vaccines can be significantly improved by the addition of tandem copies of the complement fragment C3d. We sought to determine if the efficacy of a circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-based DNA vaccine delivered to mouse skin by gene gun was improved by using this strategy. Instead, we found that C3d suppressed the protective immunity against Plasmodium berghei malaria infection and deviated immunity, most notably by suppressing the induction of antibodies specific for the CSP C-terminal flanking sequence and by suppressing the induction of CSP-specific IL-4-producing spleen cells. We further showed that C3d bound to the C-terminal flanking sequence of the CSP, which may explain the immune deviation observed in CS/C3d chimeric antigen. We have thus identified C3d-mediated epitope masking and shifting of both the humoral and cellular immune responses as a potential novel escape mechanism, which plasmodia may use to divert the induction of protective immunity",Infectious_Disease,Eukaryota,PLASMO

We generated mice deficient in Qa-1 to develop an understanding of this process. Qa-1-deficient mice develop exaggerated secondary CD4 responses to foreign and self peptides. Enhanced responses to proteolipid protein self peptide were associated with resistance of Qa-1-deficient CD4 T cells to Qa-1-restricted CD8 T suppressor activity and increased susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

15194781,"CD8(+) T lymphocytes have been shown to be involved in controlling poxvirus infection, but no protective cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes are defined for variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, or for vaccinia virus. Of several peptides in vaccinia virus predicted to bind HLA-A2.1, three, VETFsm(498-506), A26L(6-14), and HRP2(74-82), were found to bind HLA-A2.1. Splenocytes from HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice immunized with vaccinia virus responded only to HRP2(74-82) at 1 week and to all three epitopes by ex vivo enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay at 4 weeks postimmunization. To determine if these epitopes could elicit a protective CD8(+) T-cell response, we challenged peptide-immunized HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice intranasally with a lethal dose of the WR strain of vaccinia virus. HRP2(74-82) peptide-immunized mice recovered from infection, while naive mice died. Depletion of CD8(+) T cells eliminated protection. Protection of HHD-2 mice, lacking mouse class I major histocompatibility complex molecules, implicates CTLs restricted by human HLA-A2.1 as mediators of protection. These results suggest that HRP2(74-82), which is shared between vaccinia and variola viruses, may be a CD8(+) T-cell epitope of vaccinia virus that will provide cross-protection against smallpox in HLA-A2.1-positive individuals, representing almost half the population",Infectious_Disease,dsDNA_Virus,POX
15651071,"BACKGROUND: Human prostate specific antigen (PSA) is expressed selectively in prostate epithelium and is a potential target for the immunotherapy against prostate cancer. Various PSA-based vaccines have been reported to induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in animal models. Here, we present the identification and validation of an immunodominant CTL epitope of PSA in C57Bl/6 mice (H-2(b)). METHODS: PSA-specific CTLs were induced by immunization with a plasmid expressing PSA. Epitope specificity of the CTLs was determined by their reactivity against a panel of C-terminus truncated or mutated PSA proteins and use of bioinformatical prediction with the SYFPEITHI algorithm. RESULTS: The majority of PSA-specific CTLs were directed against a single H-2D(b) restricted epitope corresponding to the amino acid residues 65-74 (HCIRNKSVIL) of the protein. The CTLs had similar functional avidity against two putative H-2D(b) binding peptides: a 9-aa-long psa65-73 (HCIRNKSVI) and a 10-aa-long psa65-74 (HCIRNKSVIL). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the psa65-73 peptide can be used for reactivation of PSA-specific CTLs in vitro and ex vivo, and H-2D(b) pentamers assembled with this peptide are an efficient tool for monitoring of PSA-specific CTL responses after DNA vaccination.

With this procedure, crossreaction that would ordinarily arise from the chemical or metabolic instability of an authentic PGE2 immunogen was avoided. Antibodies raised against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate of 9-deoxy-9-methylene-PGF2alpha had an average intrinsic association constant, Ko = 2.6 X 10(9) liters.mole-1, for PGE2.

15585315,"The study of monoclonal antibodies raised against defined hapten epitopes has been a useful approach to understanding antibody repertoire. The situation in which antibodies are raised against different epitopes of the same hapten but have some common recognition or binding features has been less frequently examined. To explore the latter situation, we have characterized three monoclonal antibodies previously raised against two structurally different epitopes of the same organophosphorus nerve agent hapten, pinacolymethyl phosphonofluoridate (soman). Two antibodies, BE2-IA10 (BE2) and CC1-IIA4 (CC1), raised against the hydrophobic pinacolyl motif of soman, bind exclusively to soman and not to any other organophosphorus nerve agents. We determined that these antibodies have the same heavy chain sequence, which they share with the unrelated antibodies MOPC 21 and H17-L19. While all these antibodies share the same heavy chain sequence, they each possess different light chain sequences. Binding studies revealed that each of these antibodies has a unique reactivity with a panel of structurally related ligands, suggesting that the light chains are critically important in determining specificity in these antibodies. The third antibody, #2.ID8.2, raised against the methyl phosphoryl portion of soman, has unique heavy and light chain sequences. This antibody binds to all the currently identified chemical warfare agents. Given that the presenting epitope used to induce #2.ID8.2 is common to sarin, soman, tabun and VX, the ability of this antibody to recognize each of these haptens versus the inability of BE2 or CC1 to do so demonstrates the important role that immunogen design can play in the specificity of an antibody response",Other,Role,PSYC

These samples were also tested for the determination of levels of isotypic antibodies against the shared epitope involving 16-mer synthetic peptides containing the EQRRAA or ESSRAL sequences and compared to scrambled control peptide by using an enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay method. Significantly elevated levels of IgG and IgM antibodies to P. mirabilis and antibodies against both EQRRAA and ESSRAL peptides were detected in sera of Finnish patients with early and advanced RA, and in Japanese patients from Otsu or Tokyo compared to their corresponding control groups. In contrast, no difference either in the total or in any of the isotypic antibodies were observed between these groups when serum samples were screened against each of E. coli and S. marcescens or against the control peptide.

Fresh isolated cells expressed HLA class II molecules, which were lost upon culture, but could be up-regulated after coculture with human recombinant interferon-gamma. The antigen-presenting capacity of these mesothelial cells was tested with allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in a mixed lymphocyte mesothelial cell culture and by stimulating autologous PBMC with purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cloned T cells from the same patient allowed us to test the ability of mesothelial cells to present a mutant Ras-derived peptide to specific T cells in a DLA-DR-restricted manner. Mesothelial cells effectively stimulated allogeneic resting T lymphocytes to proliferate and presented soluble protein antigen or a mutant Ras-derived peptide to specific T cells, indicating that they display processing and presenting capabilities. Since mesothelial cells are in close anatomical relationship with intraabdominal malignancies, they may contribute to stimulation of specific T cells by endocytosing tumour-specific antigens and presenting them to T lymphocytes. This could be a possible mechanism in which mesothelial cells participate in maintaining local specific immunity in patients already primed",Cancer,Cancer,RAS

C2 CTLs, cloned from human CTLs infiltrating a renal cell carcinoma, kill cancer cells overexpressing fibroblast growth factor-5 (FGF-5). Here we show that C2 cells recognize human leukocyte antigen-A3 MHC class I molecules presenting a nine-residue FGF-5 peptide generated by protein splicing. This process, previously described strictly in plants and unicellular organisms, entails post-translational excision of a polypeptide segment followed by ligation of the newly liberated carboxy-terminal and amino-terminal residues. The occurrence of protein splicing in vertebrates has important implications for the complexity of the vertebrate proteome and for the immune recognition of self and foreign peptides",Cancer,Cancer,RENAL

However, little is known about epitope specificities and functional roles of the Gag-specific helper T-cell responses in terms of vaccine-induced protection against a pathogenic retroviral challenge. We have previously demonstrated that immunization with Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) Gag proteins protects mice against the fatal Friend retrovirus (FV) infection. We report here the structure of a protective T helper cell (Th) epitope, (I)VTWEAIAVDPPP, identified in the p15 (MA) region of F-MuLV Gag. In mice immunized with the Th epitope-harboring peptide or a vaccinia virus-expressed native full-length MA protein, FV-induced early splenomegaly regressed rapidly. In these mice, FV-infected cells were eliminated within 4 weeks and the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies was induced rapidly after FV challenge, resulting in strong protection against the virus infection. Interestingly, mice immunized with the whole MA mounted strong CD4+ T-cell responses to the identified Th epitope, whereas mice immunized with mutant MA proteins that were not bound to the plasma membrane failed to mount efficient CD4+ T-cell responses, despite the presence of the Th epitope. These mutant MA proteins also failed to induce strong protection against FV challenge. These data indicate the importance of the properly processible MA molecule for CD4+ T-cell priming and for the resultant induction of an effective immune response against retrovirus infections",Infectious_Disease,Retro-Transcribing_Virus,RET
14734527,"The products of the human leukocyte antigen subtypes HLA-B*2705 and HLA-B*2709 differ only in residue 116 (Asp vs. His) within the peptide binding groove but are differentially associated with the autoimmune disease ankylosing spondylitis (AS); HLA-B*2705 occurs in AS-patients, whereas HLA-B*2709 does not. The subtypes also generate differential T cell repertoires as exemplified by distinct T cell responses against the self-peptide pVIPR (RRKWRRWHL). The crystal structures described here show that pVIPR binds in an unprecedented dual conformation only to HLA-B*2705 molecules. In one binding mode, peptide pArg5 forms a salt bridge to Asp116, connected with drastically different interactions between peptide and heavy chain, contrasting with the second, conventional conformation, which is exclusively found in the case of B*2709. These subtype-dependent differences in pVIPR binding link the emergence of dissimilar T cell repertoires in individuals with HLA-B*2705 or HLA-B*2709 to the buried Asp116/His116 polymorphism and provide novel insights into peptide presentation by major histocompatibility antigens",Autoimm,RA,RF
15708987,"Immunization with a killed or inactivated viral vaccine provides significant protection in animals against challenge with certain corresponding pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs). However, the promise of this approach in humans is hampered by serious concerns over the risk of leaking live severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses. In this study, we generated a SARS vaccine candidate by using the live-attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as a vector. The full-length SARS-CoV envelope Spike (S) glycoprotein gene was introduced into the deletion III region of the MVA genome. The newly generated recombinant MVA, ADS-MVA, is replication incompetent in mammalian cells and highly immunogenic in terms of inducing potent neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and monkeys. After two intramuscular vaccinations with ADS-MVA alone, the 50% inhibitory concentration in serum was achieved with reciprocal sera dilutions of more than 1,000- to 10,000-fold in these animals. Using fragmented S genes as immunogens, we also mapped a neutralizing epitope in the region of N-terminal 400 to 600 amino acids of the S glycoprotein (S400-600), which overlaps with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-binding region (RBR; S318-510). Moreover, using a recombinant soluble RBR-Fc protein, we were able to absorb and remove the majority of the neutralizing antibodies despite observing that the full S protein tends to induce a broader spectrum of neutralizing activities in comparison with fragmented S proteins. Our data suggest that a major mechanism for neutralizing SARS-CoV likely occurs through blocking the interaction between virus and the cellular receptor ACE2. In addition, ADS-MVA induced potent immune responses which very likely protected Chinese rhesus monkeys from pathogenic SARS-CoV challenge",Infectious_Disease,ssRNA_positive,SARS

Therefore, there is a strong need to develop selective estrogen receptor modulators with better tissue selectivity. In a recent study (Peptides, 2002, Vol. 3, 573-580), we used a monoclonal antibody to estradiol (mAb-E2) to screen a phage-display peptide library. We identified a 15-mer peptide (peptide H5) that recognizes mAb-E2 (IC(50) 1 microM) and estrogen receptor (ER)alpha (IC(50) 500 microM) but not ERbeta, and displays estrogen-like activity in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we designed and prepared peptides based on peptide H5, which possess improved estrogenic activity, by evaluating their binding to mAb-E2 and to ERs. Initially, we determined the minimal binding sequence of peptide H5 capable of binding mAb-E2 and ER.

15642139,"Anti-Sm antibodies, identified in 1966 by Tan and Kunkel, are highly specific serological markers for systemic lupus erythrematosus (SLE). Anti-Sm reactivity is found in 5-30% of SLE patients, depending on the autoantibody detection system and the racial background of the SLE population. The Sm autoantigen complex comprises at least nine different polypeptides. All of these core proteins can serve as targets of the anti-Sm B-cell response, but most frequently the B and D polypeptides are involved. Because the BB'Sm proteins share cross-reactive epitopes (PPPGMRPP) with U1 specific ribonucleoproteins, which are more frequently targeted by antibodies that are present in patients with mixed connective tissue disease, the SmD polypeptides are regarded as the Sm autoantigens that are most specific to SLE. It was recently shown that the polypeptides D1, D3 and BB' contain symmetrical dimethylarginine, which is a component of a major autoepitope within the carboxyl-terminus of SmD1. In one of those studies, a synthetic dimethylated peptide of SmD1 (amino acids 95-119) exhibited significantly increased immunoreactivity as compared with unmodified SmD1 peptide. Using immobilized peptides, we confirmed that the dimethylated arginine residues play an essential role in the formation of major SmD1 and SmD3 autoepitopes. Moreover, we demonstrated that one particular peptide of SmD3 represents a more sensitive and more reliable substrate for the detection of a subclass of anti-Sm antibodies. Twenty-eight out of 176 (15.9%) SLE patients but only one out of 449 (0.2%) control individuals tested positive for the anti-SmD3 peptide (SMP) antibodies in a new ELISA system. These data indicate that anti-SMP antibodies are exclusively present in sera from SLE patients. Thus, anti-SMP detection using ELISA represents a new serological marker with which to diagnose and discriminate between systemic autoimmune disorders",Autoimm,Lupus,SM

Sequence similarity analysis was carried out by searching known cDNA sequences from brain tissue. The cDNA database search yielded three sequences that were identical to sequences in OspA.

15683447,"Congenital heart block is a passively transferred autoimmune condition, which affects the children of mothers with Ro/SSA autoantibodies. During pregnancy, the antibodies are transported across the placenta and affect the fetus. We have previously demonstrated that antibodies directed to the 200-239 amino acid (aa) stretch of the Ro52 component of the Ro/SSA antigen correlate with the development of congenital heart block. In this report, we investigated the antibody-antigen interaction of this target epitope in detail at a molecular and structural level. Peptides representing aa 200-239 (p200) with structurally derived mutations were synthesized to define the epitopes recognized by two Ro52 human monoclonal antibodies, S3A8 and M4H1, isolated from patient-derived phage display libraries. Analyses by ELISA, circular dichroism and MALDI-TOF-MS demonstrate that the antibody recognition is dependent on a partly alpha-helical fold within the putative leucine zipper of the 200-239 aa stretch and that the two human anti-p200 monoclonal antibodies, M4H1 and S3A8, recognize different epitopic structures within the p200 peptide. In addition, we investigated the representation of each fine specificity within the sera of mothers with children born with congenital heart block, and in such sera, antibodies of the S3A8 idiotype were more commonly detected and at higher levels than M4H1-like antibodies",Autoimm,Lupus,SSA

Preventive vaccines could be developed on the basis to abrogate unwanted immune responses to defined autodeterminants. In this study it is shown that immunization of BALB/c mice with two linear T and B cell epitopes of the human La/SSB autoantigen (spanning the regions 289-308aa and 349-364aa) and their complementary forms specified by the complementary mRNA, results in characteristic B and T cell responses. Mice immunized with the 289-308aa epitope or its complementary peptide elicited specific antibodies against both epitopes. In contrast, mice immunized with the 349-364aa epitope or its complementary peptide mounted antibody titres against the immunizing peptide only. According to these data, the 289-308aa epitope and its complementary form were capable to generate an idiotypic-anti-idiotypic response, which were cross-regulated. Peptide-specific T cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro revealed the induction of a two-stage T helper response (Th1-->Th2 type) after immunization with either the epitope 289-308 or its complementary peptide. IgG1 was the predominant subclass after immunization with the two forms of epitopes 289-308 and 349-364, while a response of the IgG2b > IgG2a was obtained after the immunization with the complementary form of 349-364 epitope reflecting the TH2/TH1 polarization, respectively.

Even though antibody mediated protection has been studied, information on antibody specificity directed to individual antigenic determinants of the protein is incomplete.To obtain immunogens with low toxicity, we generated a double-site mutant (dmTSST-1), modified at solvent-exposed residues predicted to be important for both MHC class II and TCR binding, and detoxified recombinantly expressed TSST-1 (rTSST-1) as well as native TSST-1 (nTSST-1) isolated from Staphylococcus aureus by treatment with formaldehyde. Rabbits were immunized with rTSST-1, nTSST-1, dmTSST-1, and formaldehyde inactivated toxoids. The sera obtained were used to map the antigen-reactive regions of the molecule and to identify specificities of antibodies induced by immunization with the different antigens. To detect linear antigenic epitopes of TSST-1 the reactivity of the sera with 11-meric peptides having an overhang of four residues, covering the entire molecule of TSST-1, have been studied.

The PADRE-ASREAK sequence was injected in mice by the intramuscular route. Antibodies against M protein were detected in extracts of mucosal tissues and in serum. The repertoire isotypes of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA and IgG antibodies varied, according to the dose of injected peptide. The highest mucosal IgA antibody response was obtained with 0.01 micro g of antigen per injection, whereas the systemic IgG antibody response increased with 10 micro g of antigen.

14747540,"Mice that express the viral oncoprotein simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (T-Ag) as a transgene provide useful models for the assessment of the state of the host immune response in the face of spontaneous tumor progression. Line SV11 (H2(b)) mice develop rapidly progressing choroid plexus tumors due to expression of full-length T-Ag from the SV40 promoter. In addition, T-Ag expression in the thymus of SV11 mice results in the deletion of CD8(+) T cells specific for the three H2(b)-restricted immunodominant epitopes of T-Ag. Whether CD8(+) T cells specific for the immunorecessive H2-D(b)-restricted epitope V of T-Ag survive negative selection in SV11 mice has not been determined. Immunization of SV11 mice with rVV-ES-V, a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing epitope V as a minigene, resulted in the induction of weak, but reproducible, epitope V-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. This weak lytic response corresponded with a decreased frequency of epitope V-specific CTL that could be recruited in SV11 mice. In addition, CTL lines derived from rVV-ES-V-immunized SV11 mice had reduced avidities compared to that seen with CTL derived from healthy mice. Despite this initial weak response, significant numbers of epitope V-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected in SV11 mice ex vivo following a priming-boosting approach and these cells demonstrated high avidity for epitope V. The results suggest that low numbers of tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells with high avidity for epitope V survive negative selection in SV11 mice but can be expanded by specific boosting approaches in the tumor bearing host",Infectious_Disease,dsDNA_Virus,SV40

15538612,"Telomerase is an important tumor marker but few antibodies to the enzyme have been described or used without difficulty in histochemical detection. Here we report specific detection of the enzyme in cell and tissue preparations using a new monoclonal antibody (mAb 476) and a new antigen-retrieval buffer (Enhancing buffer). When used to detect telomerase under normal immunostaining conditions in HL-60 cells or tissue sections of hepatocellular carcinoma or metastatic choriocarcinoma, unexpectedly, the antibody stained the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. Nuclear staining, however, was revealed using the Enhancing buffer. Since other nuclear antigens in the HL-60 cell could be stained both ordinarily and in the Enhancing buffer, nuclear telomerase appears to be shrouded by the nuclear matrix or blocked by accessory proteins. The cytoplasmic activity seen in normal buffer but absent largely from the Enhancing buffer may be an artifact or the nascent, 'naked' enzyme. With a known cytoplasmic antigen (proteinase-3) chosen arbitrarily for comparison, the antigenicity was found enhanced, instead, by the Enhancing buffer. The mode of action of the Enhancing buffer differs from that of microwave irradiation or the signal amplification (CSA) used by some investigators. The latter was found to enhance the cytoplasmic reactivity rather than the nuclear reactivity of mAb 476",Cancer,Cancer,TERT
11722065,"BACKGROUND: Previous work has shown that antibodies against porcine antigens are an important trigger of hyperacute lung rejection (HALR). The relative importance of Gal alpha1,3Gal epitopes and other antigens, such as those expressed on pig platelet membranes or lung itself, has not been defined. This study compares the efficiency of three anti-pig antibody depletion strategies, and their efficacy with regard to attenuation of HALR. METHODS: Plasma pooled from three human donors was adsorbed against Gal alpha1,3Gal disaccharide or porcine platelet extract (PPE), or passed through pig lung vasculature. Whole blood reconstituted using adsorbed plasma was then used to perfuse piglet lung, and results were compared with unmodified human blood. RESULTS: Depletion of lung-reactive anti-Gal alpha1-3Gal antibodies was most efficient with the alphaGal column (99% +/- 0.5% vs 87% to 93% +/- 11% for PPE and 92% to 95% +/- 8% for lung, p < 0.01 vs alphaGal column). PPE column tended to be more efficient (77% to 84% +/- 12%) in removing anti-PPE antibodies than pig lung (66% to 70% +/- 14%) or the alphaGal column (56% to 63% +/- 16%, p < 0.05). Lung survival and function with each antibody depletion strategy was improved relative to unmodified controls (mean survival > or = 146 minutes vs 8 minutes for controls). Although alphaGal and lung adsorption yielded more consistent lung protection (survival beyond 2 hours) than did PPE, no approach proved significantly superior. Complement C3a elaboration at 10 minutes was attenuated > 80% by each adsorption strategy, an effect that was most pronounced in the lung adsorption group (95%, p < 0.01). Histamine elaboration was blunted significantly by PPE adsorption but not in other groups (p < 0.05). Platelet but not leukocyte sequestration was decreased with antibody depletion compared with the nondepleted group (44% to 50% vs 82%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Each antibody depletion strategy tested significantly prolongs lung xenograft survival and function compared with unmodified human blood, but none was sufficient to reliably prevent HALR. Depletion of antibodies against both alphaGal and additional cell membrane antigens, or control of antibody-independent pathogenic pathways, may be necessary to consistently prevent HALR",Transplant,Transplant,THRO
15476815,"The Thomsen-Friedenreich disaccharide (TF) is a promising target antigen for tumor immunotherapy, since it is almost exclusively expressed in carcinoma tissues. The TF-specific antibodies generated so far are IgMs of mouse origin with limited therapeutic potential. Phage-displayed scFv repertoires are an established source for recombinant antibodies; however, we were unable to identify scFvs binding to TF when applying libraries in the standard monovalent display format of phagemid systems. Here, we report on the successful selection of TF-specific antibody fragments using a multivalent scFv phagemid library format based on shortened linkers (one amino acid residue). The libraries were constructed from mice immunized with asialoglycophorin and selected using TF displayed on two different carrier molecules in combination with the proteolytically cleavable helper phage KM13. All isolated clones encoded the same framework genes and the same complementarity-determining regions. After affinity maturation only scFv with the founder sequence were selected from secondary repertoires. This indicates a very narrow sequence window for TF-specific antibodies. Investigating other linker-length formats revealed a clear inverse correlation between linker length and binding activity both as soluble proteins and displayed on phages. The highest affinity was obtained with the tetrameric format. The selected scFv was specific for TF on various carrier molecules and tumor cells and performed well in ELISA and immunohistochemistry. We postulate that scFv phagemid library formats with short linkers (i.e. multimeric scFvs) may, in general, be advantageous in selections for the generation of scFvs against carbohydrate epitopes or other epitopes associated with low intrinsic affinity per binding site), and expect that they will be superior in applications for diagnosis or therapy",Cancer,Cancer,TN
15699107,"Cell-based vaccines consisting of invariant chain-negative tumor cells transfected with syngeneic MHC class II (MHC II) and costimulatory molecule genes are prophylactic and therapeutic agents for the treatment of murine primary and metastatic cancers. Vaccine efficacy is due to direct presentation of endogenously synthesized, MHC II-restricted tumor peptides to CD4(+) T cells. Because the vaccine cells lack invariant chain, we have hypothesized that, unlike professional APC, the peptide-binding groove of newly synthesized MHC II molecules may be accessible to peptides, allowing newly synthesized MHC II molecules to bind peptides that have been generated in the proteasome and transported into the endoplasmic reticulum via the TAP complex. To test this hypothesis, we have compared the Ag presentation activity of multiple clones of TAP-negative and TAP-positive tumor cells transfected with I-A(k) genes and the model Ag hen egg white lysozyme targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum or cytoplasm. Absence of TAP does not diminish Ag presentation of three hen egg white lysozyme epitopes. Likewise, cells treated with proteasomal and autophagy inhibitors are as effective APC as untreated cells. In contrast, drugs that block endosome function significantly inhibit Ag presentation. Coculture experiments demonstrate that the vaccine cells do not release endogenously synthesized molecules that are subsequently endocytosed and processed in endosomal compartments. Collectively, these data indicate that vaccine cell presentation of MHC II-restricted endogenously synthesized epitopes occurs via a mechanism independent of the proteasome and TAP complex, and uses a pathway that overlaps with the classical endosomal pathway for presentation of exogenously synthesized molecules",Other,Peptidic_Antigen,TOT

This candidate vaccine antigen is related to a protective antigen of Toxoplasma gondii, Hsp30/bag1, and both are members of the alpha-crystallin family of proteins that can serve as molecular chaperones. In the present study, immunofluorescence microscopy determined that Hsp20 is expressed intracellularly in all merozoites. Importantly, Hsp20 is also expressed by tick larval stages, including sporozoites, so that natural tick-transmitted infection could boost a vaccine-induced response. The predicted amino acid sequence of Hsp20 from merozoites is completely conserved among different B. bovis strains. To define the location of CD4+ T-cell epitopes for inclusion in a multiepitope peptide or minigene vaccine construct, truncated recombinant Hsp20 proteins and overlapping peptides were tested for their ability to stimulate T cells from immune cattle. Both amino-terminal (amino acids [aa] 1 to 105) and carboxy-terminal (aa 48 to 177) regions were immunogenic for the majority of cattle in the study, stimulating strong proliferation and IFN-gamma production. T-cell lines from all individuals with distinct DRB3 haplotypes responded to aa 11 to 62 of Hsp20, which contained one or more immunodominant epitopes for each animal. One epitope, DEQTGLPIKS (aa 17 to 26), was identified by T-cell clones.

A synthetic peptide spanning this region reacted strongly with 89.8% of the serum samples from T. cruzi-infected individuals. This indicates that the main antigenic site is defined by the linear sequence of the peptide rather than a conformation-dependent structure.

We identified the epitopes on Tg recognized by TgAb-positive sera from patients with DTC and examined the association between epitope specificity patterns and Tg recovery. METHODS: We tested 50 DTC sera for Tg epitope specificity, TgAbs, and Tg recovery. Epitope recognition was determined by use of a panel of 10 well-characterized Tg monoclonal antibodies directed against 6 Tg antigenic clusters (I-VI) in competitive reactions with test sera. Tg was measured by the Thyroglobuline IRMA (CIS bio international). Recovery of added Tg (TgREC) was determined by an in-house assay. RESULTS: Epitope recognition was restricted to immunodominant clusters in 58% of patients, whereas the rest were either broadly heterogeneous (16%) or nonreactive (26%). Median Tg recovery did not differ between sera with restricted and unrestricted specificities (68.7% vs 80.5%; P >0.05). TgREC was inversely correlated with the total number of epitopes recognized by sera (r = -0.66; P <0.001).

15163889,"Human type 1 diabetes is thought to be mediated by autoreactive T cells specific for antigens expressed by pancreatic beta cells. However, it is unclear which autoantigens and determinants thereof are the targets of the autoimmune attack. Using comprehensive peptide libraries that cover the entire sequence of two major candidate autoantigens, GAD65 and proinsulin, we measured the in vivo frequencies of peptide-specific, IFN-gamma-producing memory T cells in 27 diabetic patients, 14 high risk individuals, and 15 partially HLA-matched healthy controls. Compared to the controls, both a higher number of determinants on the islet cell antigens were recognized and the frequencies of peptide specific cells were increased in patients and high risk individuals. Inclusion of signal enhancing anti-CD28 antibody further accentuated this difference. Considerable heterogeneity in peptide recognition was seen even in DRB1*04, DQB1*0302 matched individuals. Unlike its peptides, the GAD protein antigen did not recall a T cell memory response. The highly heterogeneous recognition of a multitude of peptide determinants on both autoantigens, occurring in the absence of protein recognition, and the low functional avidity of the memory cells involved jointly suggest that the autoimmune T cell repertoire in human type 1 diabetes primarily targets cryptic determinants engaged by determinant spreading",Autoimm,Diabetes,VARDB
15372502,"Susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated genetically with human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles, including DRB1*1501, DRB5*0101, and DQB1*0602, and it is possible that these alleles contribute to MS through an enhanced ability to present encephalitogenic myelin peptides to pathogenic T cells. HLA-DRB1*1502, which contains glycine instead of valine at position 86 of the P1 peptide-binding pocket, is apparently not genetically associated with MS. To identify possible differences between these alleles in their antigen-presenting function, we determined if T-cell responses to known DRB1*1501-restricted myelin peptides might be diminished or absent in transgenic (Tg) DRB1*1502-expressing mice. We found that Tg DRB1*1502 mice had moderate to strong T-cell responses to several myelin peptides with favorable DRB1*1501 binding motifs, notably myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-35-55 (which was also encephalitogenic), proteolipid protein (PLP)-95-116, and MOG-194-208, as well as other PLP and MOG peptides. These peptides, with the exception of MOG-194-208, were also immunogenic in healthy human donors expressing either DRB1*1502 or DRB1*1501. In contrast, the DRB1*1502 mice had weak or absent responses to peptides with unfavorable DRB1*1501 binding motifs. Overall, none of the DRB1*1501-restricted myelin peptides tested selectively lacked immunogenicity in association with DRB1*1502. These results indicate that the difference in risk association with MS of DRB1*1501 versus DRB1*1502 is not due to a lack of antigen presentation by DRB1*1502, at least for this set of myelin peptides, and suggest that other mechanisms involving DRB1*1501 may account for increased susceptibility to MS",Autoimm,Multiple_Sclerosis,VARMS

Results The Api m [1/2] fusion protein induced T-cell proliferation and both T H 1-type and T H 2-type cytokine responses. In contrast, IgE reactivity was abolished, and profoundly reduced basophil degranulation and type 1 skin test reactivity was observed. Pretreatment of mice with Api m [1/2] fusion protein significantly suppressed the development of specific IgE as well as other antibody isotypes after immunization with the native allergen. Conclusion The novel fusion protein of 2 major allergens bypasses IgE binding and mast cell/basophil IgE FcepsilonRI crosslinking and protects from IgE development",Allergen,Eukar,VENOM
15663569,"BACKGROUND: Laboratory animal allergy (LAA) is an important cause of occupational sensitization and asthma. Rats are a frequent cause of LAA and the major rat allergen, Rat n 1, is a member of the lipocalin protein family, which includes several other animal allergens such as the cow allergen, Bos d 2. To date, Bos d 2 is the only mammalian lipocalin allergen to have been studied in detail. OBJECTIVE: We undertook a cross-sectional study of a large population of individuals exposed to laboratory rats to determine the proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to the major rat allergen, Rat n 1. METHODS: Eighty-three cases (defined by a positive skin prick test (SPT) > or =3 mm and/or a positive RAST > or =2% binding) and 274 referents without specific IgE to rats were tested for their proliferative responses of PBMCs to rat allergen. Cytokine release to rat urinary protein was examined in 28 sensitized and 42 non-sensitized exposed individuals. RESULTS: Proliferation to rat urinary protein was weak in all individuals. Four regions within Rat n 1 were identified as containing potential immunodominant T cell epitopes and three of these co-localized within the conserved regions of the lipocalin molecule. All four regions within Rat n 1 overlapped considerably with the characterized epitopes of the lipocalin allergen, Bos d 2. IL-5 and ratios of IL-5/IFN-gamma were significantly increased in cases. CONCLUSION: The response to Rat n 1 is remarkably similar to the cow lipocalin allergen Bos d 2. T cell epitopes within lipocalins appear to co-localize with the conserved regions of the molecule. LAA is characterized by an increased production of IL-5. Investigation of other lipocalin allergens will provide further information about the allergenicity of this group of proteins",Allergen,Eukar,VERT

15483241,"A novel, linear B-cell epitope has been identified at the N terminus of the rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein. Screening of a phage-display library demonstrated that two glycoprotein-specific mAbs recognized a conserved sequence, WxxxDI, which aligned between aa 14 and 19 of the mature glycoprotein. Screening of truncated glycoprotein fragments with both mAbs confirmed the location of the epitope in the N-terminal region. Alignment of amino acid sequences from a range of RABV isolates indicated that the site was conserved in most viruses. Alignment with representatives of other lyssaviruses suggested that it is conserved within phylogroup I, which includes the European bat lyssaviruses, but not phylogroup II. A 12 aa synthetic peptide of this epitope was recognized by both mAbs and sera from a subset of rabies-vaccinated dogs. In a multimeric form, the peptide could induce an epitope-specific response following immunization in rabbits and mice",Infectious_Disease,ssRNA_negative,VSV
15706401,"Prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are believed to result from the misfolding of a widely expressed normal cellular prion protein, PrPc. The resulting disease-associated isoforms, PrPSc, have much higher beta-sheet content, are insoluble in detergents, and acquire relative resistance to proteases. Although known to be highly aggregated and to form amyloid fibrils, the molecular architecture of PrPSc is poorly understood. To date, it has been impossible to elicit antibodies to native PrPSc that are capable of recognizing PrPSc without denaturation, even in Prn-Po/o mice that are intolerant of it. Here we demonstrate that antibodies for native PrPc and PrPSc can be produced by immunization of Prn-Po/o mice with partially purified PrPc and PrPSc adsorbed to immunomagnetic particles using high-affinity anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Interestingly, the polyclonal response to PrPSc was predominantly of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype, unlike the immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses elicited by PrPc or by recombinant PrP adsorbed or not to immunomagnetic particles, presumably reflecting the polymeric structure of disease-associated prion protein. Although heat-denatured PrPSc elicited more diverse antibodies with the revelation of C-terminal epitopes, remarkably, these were also predominantly IgM suggesting that the increasing immunogenicity, acquisition of protease sensitivity, and reduction in infectivity induced by heat are not associated with dissociation of the PrP molecules in the diseased-associated protein. Adsorbing native proteins to immunomagnetic particles may have general applicability for raising polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to any native protein, without attempting laborious purification steps that might affect protein conformation",Infectious_Disease,Eukaryota,WORM
15534094,"The Wilms tumor protein (WT1) is overexpressed in most acute and chronic leukemias. To develop a practicable, clinically applicable approach for generation of WT1-specific T cells and to comparatively evaluate the immunogenicity of WT1 in normal individuals, we sensitized T cells from 13 HLA-A0201+ and 5 HLA-A2402+ donors with autologous EBV-transformed B cells or cytokine-activated monocytes, loaded with the HLA-A0201-binding WT1 peptides (126-134)RMFPNAPYL or (187-195)SLGEQQYSV or a newly identified HLA-A2402-binding WT1 peptide (301-310)RVPGVAPTL. WT1-specific T cells were regularly generated from each donor. T cells sensitized with peptide-loaded EBV-transformed B cells generated higher numbers of WT1-specific T cells than peptide-loaded cytokine-activated monocytes. Contrary to expectations, the frequencies of WT1 peptide-specific T cells were equivalent to those generated against individual highly immunogenic HLA-A0201-binding EBV peptides. Each of these T-cell lines specifically killed WT1+ leukemias and solid tumors in an HLA-restricted manner but did not lyse autologous or HLA-matched normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells or reduce their yield of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), or mixed colonies (CFU-mix). Furthermore, WT1 peptide-specific T cells after adoptive transfer into nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts of WT1+ and WT1- HLA-A0201+ leukemias preferentially accumulated in and induced regressions of WT1+ leukemias that expressed the restricting HLA allele. Such cells are clinically applicable and may prove useful for adoptive cell therapy of WT1+ malignant diseases in humans",Cancer,Cancer,WT1
15699758,"BACKGROUND.: Rejection mediated by antibody recognition of the alpha-Gal epitope (Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc-R) is a major barrier in porcine-to-human xenotransplantation. Because the synthesis of alpha-Gal is dependent on alpha1,3 galactosyltransferase (alpha1,3GT), methods of blocking this enzyme are needed. RNA interference induced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a powerful technique for allowing the silencing of mammalian genes with great specificity and potency. In this study, we use siRNA for silencing of alpha1,3GT with the purpose of reducing expression of the alpha-Gal epitope and subsequently decreasing immunogenicity of porcine endothelial cells. METHODS.: alpha1,3GT-specific and control siRNAs were transfected into the porcine aortic endothelial cell line, PED. alpha-Gal expression was assessed by Western blotting, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence. Protection from human-complement and natural killer (NK)-cell-mediated cytotoxicity was evaluated by Cr-release assays after incubation of PED with normal human serum (NHS) and NK92 cell, respectively. RESULTS.: RNA interference was successfully achieved in PED as witnessed by the specific knock-down of alpha1,3GT mRNA levels. Flow cytometric analysis using the Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 lectin confirmed the suppression of alpha1,3GT activity as evidenced by decreased alpha-Gal. Functional relevance of the knock-down phenotype was illustrated by the finding that silenced PED were protected from cytotoxicity of NHS. Protection from NK-mediated cytotoxicity was not observed. CONCLUSIONS.: Our data are the first to demonstrate that RNA interference is a potent tool to down modulate alpha-Gal expression and to protect endothelial cells from complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Gene silencing by siRNA may represent a new approach for overcoming hyperacute and acute vascular rejection",Transplant,Transplant,XENO
